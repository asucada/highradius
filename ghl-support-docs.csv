Triggers are conditional statements (similar to Zaps in Zapier) that connect all the different modules of HighLevel together. Think of triggers as the wiring or 'secret sauce' in the back-end making all the cool things HighLevel does actually happen. Example: Let's say you have set up a Zap in Zapier to push leads into a HighLevel campaign when they fill out a form embedded in a ClickFunnels landing page. You also want to send an SMS notification to your client to let them know when this happens (the equivalent to letting them know they have a new lead) How would we do this? Answer: Set up a trigger!

Click to learn more about Workflows. Send an email and/or SMS notification to your client(s) and/or yourself when a lead is added to a campaign: TABLE OF CONTENTS How to send internal notifications for workflows Rate limiting on Workflow Notifications How to send internal notifications for workflows: Set up a new workflow: Click on Start from scratch Click on Create workflow Click on Add New Workflow Trigger Once you configured the workflow trigger: Click on Add your first Action Click on Send Internal Notification Choose the type of notification: Email notification Internal notification: SMS notification Rate limiting on Workflow Notifications We have added Rate Limiting for Internal Notification action of workflows. The current rate limits are 500 notifications / 5mins for each user (Per workflow) In the case of email, its 500 notifications per 5 mins, per user email In the case of SMS, its 500 notifications per 5 mins, per user's phone In the case of in-app notifications, its 500/5mins per user Id We will skip any notifications that are sent after breaching this limit. Why was this done, and how will this help? Because no limit was enforced, there were several updates made to a specific conversation of a user. Let's say you put 300k contacts into a workflow And in the internal notification you are sending a mail to a particular user (in most cases we have seen customers set up to send a notification to themselves) Now this particular user mail, will get 300k emails. Because of this, the conversation of this user will be updated 300k times, within a few seconds/minutes. This introduced an overall delay in processing workflow actions. The rate-limiting should have good gatekeeping for these events, and also prevent customers to send bulk emails to a particular user"

A: You can delete a Smart List by going to the ""Manage Smart Lists"" tabHowever, remember that the delete option might be greyed out if a Smart list is shared with only one userTo delete such a list, you need to first untick the userOnce the user is unticked, the delete option will become available, and you can delete the smart listQ: Can I use a Smart List to create a report for conversions from a specific tag within the contacts? A: Currently, you can create a smart list by filtering based on that specific tag, and this list can be exported as a CSVHowever, viewing conversion rates for a specific list is not directly possibleConversion rates can only be seen from pipeline statuses marked as WON on the dashboard or from adding a source to pipeline cards and seeing the lead source reporting area at the bottom of the dashboardQ: Should agency admins be able to see all smart lists even if they haven't been shared with them? A: As of the last update, this option was unavailable to the agency adminsHighLevel was working on user permissions & role-based access at a granular level, and this feature has been added to the roadmapHowever, as an agency admin, there's currently no workaround if you cannot view a smart list created by a user and not shared with youQ Can a user delete a smart list they've created if they don't have access to 'manage smart lists'? A: The only way the smart list can be deleted is to provide the end user with ""Contact"" page accessThey can then go to manage Smartlist and delete itIf the user is not supposed to view contacts data, they can be enabled with ""only assigned data"" from the permission level and provide contact page accessQ Can users manage smart lists without having 'settings' access?

Why Can't I use My Free Email Address As The SMTP?,"Why You Need Your Own Domain To Send Email You might be thinking, ""Why do I need my own domain to send email? Can't I just use my @gmail address?"" All marketing emails should be sent from a domain you own, not from a personal account at a provider domain, like @gmail, @hotmail, @yahoo, etcor in an ISP email in some casesIn almost all cases we've seen, those addresses can all issue a block whenever bulk email is sent from their domainThis is because the most important factor in email deliverability is domain reputation, and when you send mail from a Gmail account, you're actually using Gmail's reputation, not your ownNOTE: Even if your provider does not currently block email, it is very likely that all email providers will do so in the near futureThe best way forward is to create an email address at a domain that you own, so you can start building up your own domain reputation! Think of it this way When you send something in the mail, a carrier (UPS, DHL, Post Office) transports it for youBut it's still coming from you, the carrier isn't just going to pick it up off the street (hopefully), and the recipient is more likely to accept a letter coming from someone they knowEmail is much the sameHighLevel is the carrier, but it also depends on your sending reputation, and the domain email is how you build that trustHere's how to get started! There are normally three ways to add email to your domain and start sending emails with that address1Where you bought your domain Almost all domain providers will be able to provide you with an option to add email to your purchaseThen you'll have the name@domain.com address you need, and even if you don't set up the Inbox entirely you can still set up forwarding to your normal Gmail or Yahoo addressExamples are sites like Google Domains, Namecheap, and Hover2Where you host your website Many people buy their domain the same place they host their websiteBlueHost, HostGator, and GoDaddy all offer both domains and hosting so they are popular all-in-one optionsSquarespace and Wix make it easy to add email to your account with options in your dashboardNOTE: For either option, the best way to find out how to do this is simply Google ""website host and email account"", with your host/provider in the search bar3Google Suite Did you know you can still use Gmail with your domain email? It's true! You can use G Suite to manage your domain email address, plus Google Docs, Sheets, and more! Click here to sign up and get started, plans begin at $6/month"
Cold Outreach,"Why Cold Outreach? In short, we do cold outreach because it's effective, it can produce results quickly, and, most importantly, it's extremely cost effective. Warming Up Before you get started, you should think about warming up a new email address so you don't run the risk of getting your main business domain/emails flagged as spam. The easiest way to do this by following these steps: 1) Purchase a fresh domain. If your agency's domain is youragency.com, you could purchase something like youragency.co or your agency.mail, etc. 2) Create a Google Workspace account , register the new domain in Google Workspace, then create an email for that domain in Google Workspace (something like mail@youragency.co). Note, Google Workspace charges $6/month per email address. 3) Sign up for 10-20 newsletters/services using the new email address so that emails start naturally flowing into the account. Here are some good ones: Twitter, Moz, Unbounce, Convince & Convert, The Daily Carnage, Neil Patel, Seth Goden, Buffer, Marketing Drive, Total Annarchy, Sketchalaytics. 4) Send 10-20 emails to friends/family and make sure they reply. After a few days of emails going in and out of your new email account, the email address and domain will be ""warmed up"" and ready to go. You can learn more about warming up domains and IP addresses in this guide from Mailgun. Setting Up SMTP In HighLevel"

Phone Call Redirect Loop," If you're hearing a loop on phone calls or you're seeing lots of calls stack up, one after the other, in Conversations, odds are one of your users has been assigned a Twilio number but also has that number set in the Phone field in their user settings. Another possible reason is that the business phone number or the forwarding number set might look like a different number from the Twilio number, but it is configured to route back to the Twilio number. So this will cause a call loop because we will try to forward the calls to the business phone number. "

Voicemail For Company And For Users,"How to record your own voicemail Google Record mp3 onlinePick a website and record your voicemail online: Where To Upload Voicemail Files Voicemail files (mp3 format) can be set in two different places: 1) Voicemail For Users - Sub-Account > Settings > My Staff tab > Edit User > Expand Call & Voicemail Settings > Upload mp3/wav file Learn more on how to Assign Twilio Numbers to Users If the contact is assigned to the user OR if the Twilio number is assigned to the user, when they call the Twilio number and user didn't pick up, we will play the User voicemail here 2) Voicemail For The Business - Sub-Account > Settings > Business Profile tab > Scroll down to Call & Voicemail Settings > Upload mp3/wav file When the contact calls the Twilio number that's not assigned to any users, and if the contact is also not assigned to any users, we will play the Voicemail For The Business if no one picks upHow does it work? When contact calls the Twilio number, we will ring the forwarding number for 10 seconds based on the call timeout set, after 10 seconds, if no one picks up, the contact will hear the voicemail recordingMake sure Call Recording is enabled: Click on Reporting > Call Reporting > Scroll to the right and click on the arrow down button to expand each call You can also click on the contact name to listen to the recordings in the Conversation pageWhere To Control Timeout Settings To replace the original voicemail of the forwarding number, you'll need to set a ""Timeout"" number, otherwise, the call will ring by default for 60 seconds, during which time the original voicemail of the forwarding number will usually trigger and we will not be able to replace it with the uploaded recorded voicemailTimeout numbers can be set in three different places: 1) Sub Account > Settings > Team Management tab > Edit user > Call & Voicemail Settings 2) Sub Account > Settings > Phone Numbers > Pencil Icon for a specific phone number 3) Sub Account > Settings Company Tab Understanding Priorities For Timeout Settings: When a call comes into a Twilio number, it will ring for 60 seconds by default before looking for a voicemail to play unless a Timeout number has been setHighLevel will look for timeout number in the following order: First - is there a Timeout number in the user settings of the user this Twilio number is attached to? (option 1 above) Second - is there a Timeout number in the phone number settings of this number? (option 2 above) Third - is there Timeout number in the Company settings? (option 3 above) Other Notes: If a call comes into a Twilio number and a Timeout number is found but no voicemail files are found, the following default message will be played: ""We are unable to take your call right nowPlease leave a message after the beep."" Timeout numbers are not ""connected"" with any particular voicemail file, e.ga call comes into a Twilio number and HighLevel detects a timeout number set in the User's settings (but that user doesn’t have a voicemail file) and HighLevel finds a voicemail file in the Business Profile settings, HighLevel will play the voicemail file from the Business Profile settings after the number of seconds set in the Timeout field in the User's settingsTroubleshooting Company Voicemail not working 1Check if the Twilio number is assigned to the user, and make sure the user has uploaded a voicemail file2Check if there's any forwarding number / Business phone configured, we will need to forward the call somewhere in order to drop/play the uploaded voicemail- One way might be to get a Google voice number and put it in the forwarding numberSet the incoming call timeout to 1 second so it will drop the call faster in 2-3 ringsThe call timeout will need to be at least 1 second to attempt to connect the callThe idea is to drop/time out the call before the forwarding number's original voicemail is played- Or you can assign the Twilio number to a user and receive Inbound Calling on Mobile APP3Check the call timeout set, try setting the Inbound call timeout to 1 second The maximum Incoming Call Timeout should be less than 20 secondsIf the call timeout is set to be more than 20 seconds, we won't be able to replace the original voicemail as usually the original voicemail of the forwarding number will be playing by the timeIf it's already set to 20 seconds but it's still playing the forwarding number's original voicemail instead of the voicemail you uploaded, try setting the call timeout to 1 second and try calling again to see if it worksIf it works, you can gradually increase the call timeout (10 seconds, 15 seconds) to test further so it will call the forwarding number for a longer time and still be able to play the uploaded voicemail4Check if we call the forwarding number directly, does the call go to a voicemail as soon as you call it? If the forwarding number is in Do Not Disturb mode or if the number is configured to go directly to a pre-set voicemailIn that case, we won't be able to replace that voicemail because the forwarding number's original voicemail just plays immediatelyThe key is to figure out how soon your own voicemail will play and set the call timeout to drop the call before your voicemail answersIf your voicemail answers right away during Do Not Disturb mode, then we won't be able to replace the original voicemailIf you are using a Google voice number or landline, they might have their own call settings so we are not able to overwrite their configured voicemailYou may have to turn off the announce feature in Google VoiceThat may pick up as a voicemail and we are not able to overwrite its original voicemail5Check if the uploaded Voicemail file is too high quality If the voicemail file quality is high and also not an mp3 file, these instructions should help you make it compatible 1go to https://online-audio-converter.com/ and upload the voicemail file 2Convert to ECONOMY 64kbps MP3 3Upload it and call the Twilio number to test again"

SMS still coming from old Twilio number when I got a new one?,"Issue: SMS still sent from the old Twilio number when I purchase a new one and select that as the default outbound number. Reason: Since we do not want to spam the leads with different Twilio phone numbers, the old leads in HL will be stuck with the old default Twilio phone number. Only new leads got added to HL will be getting SMS from the new default outbound number. Suggestion: 1. Delete and Re-create the contact The new contacts will be using the new default Twilio number. 2. Remove the old default Twilio number We could remove the old Twilio phone number. That way all SMS will be sent from the new Twilio number bought. 3. Assign the new default Twilio number to the user, assign the user to the contact and log in as the user to send an SMS If you want to keep the old Twilio phone number, another suggestion would be to assign the new Twilio phone number to the user and log in as the user to send those SMS. You could also assign the user in the Workflow action. That way all automated SMS will be sent from the new Twilio number bought. More info: Phone numbers for users / Assign Twilio Numbers to Users"

How to validate phone numbers (SMS) ?,"Number validation refers to the process of verifying the authenticity and correctness of a phone number, specifically in the context of SMS. It ensures that the phone number you are trying to reach is valid and capable of receiving SMS messages. The validation process involves checking the format of the phone number and verifying its existence with the telecommunication provider More Tutorials from the Community https://youtu.be/-Pn3Yc4hp9s https://youtu.be/hK2iVen3J-0 https://youtu.be/j-CCz1xVi0s https://youtu.be/D-AIlzqn5GE If SMS Validation has been activated, we will check Twilio Lookup (charges per lookup) to see if the number is a landline and won't send any messages to it. Twilio Lookup also invalidates numbers that are badly formatted or don't exist. Validation is only performed when an SMS is queued before sending, not during Contact Import/Creation. If the number is identified as a landline number, we will not send even the first message to the carriers. Validation only needs to be activated in HighLevel to function (it is on by default in Twilio). How to enable SMS / Phone number Validation? Switch to the location account level -> Go to Settings -> Business Info -> General Go to Agency Settings -> Twilio -> A new column called SMS Validation *PLEASE NOTE that phone number validation is a paid service from Twilio. You can view pricing for ""Carrier Lookup"" here.

A: The Buffer setting applies universally to all appointments in your calendarIf you need different buffer times, consider creating separate calendars for different types of appointments, each with its own buffer timeQ: Can I override the Slot Interval for specific days or times in my calendar? A: The Slot Interval applies consistently across all your available hours and daysIf you require a unique interval for a specific day or time, consider creating a separate calendar for that period with its settingsQ: How do the 'Appointments per Slot' setting interact with the 'Slot Interval' setting in my calendar? A: The 'Appointments per Slot' setting determines how many appointments can be booked for each slot, while the 'Slot Interval' determines how often these slots occurIf 'Appointments per Slot' is set to '2' and your 'Slot Interval' is every 30 minutes, two appointments can be booked every 30 minutesQ: Can the 'Appointments per Day' setting limit appointments across multiple calendars? A: The 'Appointments per Day' setting is specific to each calendarIf you wish to limit appointments across multiple calendars, you must manage this manually by tracking the total number of appointments across all your calendarsQ: What happens if I change the 'Minimum Scheduling Notice' while there are pending appointments in my calendar? A: Changes to the 'Minimum Scheduling Notice' setting won't affect existing appointments but will apply to new onesFor example, if you change the notice from 24 hours to 48 hours, any appointments already scheduled within the next 48 hours will remain, but new appointments will require at least 48 hours noticeQ: Can I set the 'Date Range' for different lengths based on the appointment type in my calendar?

added security and reduces the chance of unwanted interruptions during your meetingsEach participant gets a different link, making it harder for unauthorized persons to gain accessFor instance, if you're scheduling a meeting with a client, once you select Zoom as the meeting location, the CRM will automatically create a new Zoom meeting and embed the unique meeting link within the calendar

User can start using Zoom Integration for Calendars • Each User connects their own Zoom account to their Profile, and a unique link is generated with every booking on each Group Calendar(s) the User is assigned to • Dynamic Zoom links are only available with Round Robin and Collective CalendarsIntegrating the same Zoom Account with Multiple Users Zoom integration is tied to unique User IDs in the backend, not email addressesIf a Zoom account is connected to a User ID, that same Zoom account can't be connected to a different User ID, even if it's the same email addressThis can cause issues for users with different email addresses within the same agency or users needing to connect their Zoom accounts across multiple agenciesIn specific scenarios, if a user account is deleted and restored with the help of Support, it could result in two User IDs associated with the same email addressThis could lead to further complications as the restored account couldn't reconnect to the original Zoom account due to the new User IDIt's crucial to remember that User IDs and email addresses are treated as distinct identifiers within the system, underpinning the integration with ZoomIt's essential to consider your User ID as the unique identifier for the integration, not your email addressThis might seem complex, but understanding this distinction will help avoid potential integration issues and alleviate frustrationsLet's use some examples for a better understandingConsider an agency, ""ABC Marketing."" They have three users: User A with User ID ""A001"" and email ""a@abcmarketing.com"" User B with User ID ""B002"" and email ""b@abcmarketing.com"" User C with User ID ""C003"" and email ""c@abcmarketing.com"" Users want to integrate their Zoom accounts with their respective profiles on the agency's platformUser A connects their Zoom account successfully with the User ID ""A001""Suppose, for some reason, User A's Profile is deleted and restored by the client contacting SupportUpon restoration, User A is assigned a new User ID, let's say ""A004"", while their email remains ""a@abcmarketing.com."" Here's where the confusion can startUser A tries to reconnect their Zoom accountHowever, their Zoom account is still tied to the old User ID ""A001""Therefore, when they attempt to connect using the new User ID ""A004"", the system blocks itThis is because, from the system's perspective, the Zoom account is already connected to a different User IDThis is why it's crucial to remember that Zoom integration is linked to the User ID, not the email addressThe system treats the User ID as the unique identifier when connecting to Zoom, even if the email address remains the sameOn another note, User A cannot integrate their Zoom account into User B's Profile either because the Zoom account is still tied to User ID ""A001""So, even though they are within the same agency, they cannot share a Zoom account due to these unique User IDsUnderstanding this underlying mechanism should help avoid confusion and ease the integration processPlease note: It is not recommended to connect different Zoom accounts to the same User across multiple sub-accounts or to use the same Zoom account across multiple usersStep 1: Install the Zoom integration You can configure Zoom for your scheduled meetings in the following ways: User Integrations User Profile > Integrations > Zoom > Connect In the dialog box, click Connect to Zoom (If not already connected) Enter your Zoom login credentials, then click Sign inYou'll be prompted to grant permission for Zoom to access your Zoom accountClick AllowYou'll be redirected to the platform, where Zoom appears under User Profile IntegrationsDefault Meeting Location User Profile > Default Meeting Location > Zoom > Connect In the dialog box, click Connect to Zoom (If not already connected) Enter your Zoom login credentials, then click Sign inYou'll be prompted to grant permission for Zoom to access your Zoom accountClick AllowYou'll be redirected to the platform, where Zoom appears under User Profile IntegrationsYou can then select 'Zoom' from the dropdown and hit 'Save' to prompt a dialog ascertaining whether or not existing meeting locations across all other calendars need to default to ZoomCalendar Settings Settings > Calendar Settings > User [x] > Meeting Location In the dialog box, click Connect to Zoom (If not already connected) Enter your Zoom login credentials, then click Sign inYou'll be prompted to grant permission for Zoom to access your Zoom accountClick AllowYou'll be redirected to the platform, where Zoom appears under User Profile IntegrationsYou can then select 'Zoom' from the dropdown to have the meetings include Zoom links with every bookingPlease note: You must be logged in as the user to do the profile setting integration optionsIf you are unable to find the Profile setting option within the sub account-level settings, you must edit the user's role from the agency-level Team setting to assign the user to the specific location(s)Configure Zoom for Other Users as an Admin If the Zoom integration has already been installed in your account by the respective User, you can choose that as a Default Meeting Location for the User under Team ManagementPlease note: Each User has to be currently log into their account to integrate ZoomAgency admins can now use the ""Login As User"" Feature to complete this process for any user in the agencyStep 2: Set up appointment reminder workflow with Zoom location The Workflow Builder is a potent tool with many usesStill, for this use case, it provides easy access to automate internal and external reminders of upcoming appointments, including the dynamic Zoom linkYou can craft your workflow by combining the following triggers and actions or use one of the available templated Recipesby Click on ""Add New Workflow Trigger"" Select ""Appointment Status"" as the trigger and add the following filters: Event Type: Is this a one-time appointment, a recurring appointment, or would you like it to fire for either Appointment Status: The calendar setting for auto-confirming appointments would ensure all appointments trigger this filter In Calendar: Optional if narrowing down specific calendars and specific usersClick on ""Add your first Action.""

After it's drafted, ANY contact that tries to Resume the workflow (fire a wait step for time, fire a wait step for condition, get a reply from SMS, etc) will get into the Draft Pause status and will be kept in the step that was about to resumeexample: Workflow was Published, Contact fired 1 SMS and got into a Wait for Reply StepA workflow was DraftedContact replies and is about to Resume the drafted workflowHis status is then changed to Draft Pause and he is then kept at the Wait for Reply stepAnd any contact that tries to get Added to the workflow (trigger, bulk action, etc) will not get added since it's in draft When you Publish a Drafted workflow, these things will happen immediately: All contacts with the Draft Pause status will immediately resume the step that they were stuck on example: That contact from the example above that had just waited for the SMS reply, will then perform the subsequent steps after the Wait for ReplyAll others that were just waiting for something (time, reply, etc) will keep going and won't get stuck in Draft Pause again It's good to note that there are a couple of exceptions and situations to be aware of: As I said above, if the execution is happening while you are Drafting the Workflow, we cannot stop that executionSo it will continue until it reaches a stopping point, and then will get Draft Pause when ResumingEven if the Workflow is in Draft, when using the Test Contact feature, it will allow entry, since the idea of that feature is to Test, and therefore you should be able to test Drafted workflows before Publishing them for live clientsI have a Workflow event that waits for the 30th of the month, what will happen this month (February only has 28 days)?

Call Tracking and Missed Call Text Back Through Google Business Profile," Google Business Profile (GBP) allows a business to register two phone numbers, which creates an excellent opportunity for Agencies to track calls generated from Google Business Profile listings while keeping with SEO best practices (i.e.moving the business' real phone number to the secondary slot has not been found to negatively affect rankings). The HighLevel Google Business Profile integration enables you to automatically move your client's main business number to the secondary slot and add their LeadConnector number to the first slot. When you toggle on GBP Call Tracking, the following happens: If the phone number in GBP is already a LeadConnector number from the HighLevel sub-account, nothing will be changed as the business's calls are already being tracked in HighLevel. If the phone number in GBP is also the forwarding number for any of the LeadConnector numbers in the HighLevel sub-account, HighLevel will move the current number to the secondary slot and add the LeadConnector number in the primary slot. If the phone number in GBP is not the forwarding number for any of the Twilio numbers in the corresponding HighLevel sub-account, HighLevel will move the current number to the secondary slot, add the LeadConnector number in the primary slot, and set the current number as the forwarding number for the LeadConnector number in the HighLevel sub-account.

SaaS Mode Sub-Accounts Are Not Being Generated,"If you are testing the 2-step order form tied to a SaaS Mode plan and the sale is not generating a new sub-account, the issue is likely that your sub-account is using ""Test Mode"" API keys from Stripe. Note: For SaaS Mode to work: 1) The sub-account where you'll be building the sales page with a 2-step order form tied to your SaaS Mode plans must be integrated with the same Stripe account that the agency account is integrated with. 2) Both the sub-account and the agency account need to be integrated with live Stripe API keys. To find your Stripe API keys, please refer to this Stripe Help Article on locating API keys. Also, be sure to use a valid credit card when testing, which you can then refund within Stripe when testing is complete."
SaaS User Level Permissions Vs Sub-Account Level Permissions," Sub-accounts generated through SaaS Mode (meaning the account was created by someone signing up to a Stripe Subscription that was created by the SaaS Configurator in your Agency Account) are governed by a set of Sub-Account Level permissions that are determined by the feature set of each of the plans in the SaaS Configurator. (This is located in the Agency View > SaaS Configurator > Plans & Pricing tab > Edit Details button) When the system generates the User account for the person who signed up for a SaaS Mode plan, their User Permissions are determined by the Sub-Account Level permissions. A User cannot have more permissions than the Sub-Account Level permissions allow. Adjusting Sub-Account Level Permissions To adjust Sub-Account level permissions: Go to your Agency Account (Agency View) > Sub-Accounts tab > Search for a sub-account you want to change permissions for Click the three dots > click ""Manage Client"" Scroll down to the ""Enable/Disable Products"" section, where you can toggle on/off features. Toggling on a feature unlocks the corresponding User Permission, which could be activated by going into the sub-account > Settings > Team Management, where an admin can click Edit and adjust the User Permissions.

Loop Lockouts,"Loops occur when two Triggers either feed into each other or one Trigger feeds back into itself, creating an infinite loop of actions. Loops are detrimental to app performance because they commandeer server resources, causing a slow down for all users, which is why the system now looks for potential loops and locks the Triggers that may cause them. Workflows, Triggers and Campaigns will be Loop Locked when they hit 50 Starts/Executions for the same Contact in less than 30 minutes. Example: Trigger fires 50 times for the same Contact in less than 30 minutes, or a Contact gets added to a Workflow/Campaign 50 times in less than 30 minutes. If you receive a Loop error, please contact Support so that we can review the Trigger with you, fix what would cause a loop, and unlock the Trigger."

How To Properly Leverage An Appointment Setter, 
What is Email Deliverability? - A Guest-Tutorial From Krystin Ruschman of Email-2-Inbox,"What is Email Deliverability? A Guest-Tutorial From Krystin Ruschman of Email-2-Inbox “I think my deliverability is ok…” What does that mean? Where do we see Deliverability? First, let’s make sure we’re on the same page regarding the difference between “Delivered” and “Deliverability” because they are very different! *DELIVERED* This is the stat you see in your SMTP dashboard or in your Highlevel email stats (along with opens, replies, clicks, bounces, complaints, etc.) Examples: [Mailgun Dashboard] [Highlevel Campaign] Delivery just means the email got to the recipient mail server – somewhere – could be the inbox, spam, promotions, updates – who freaking knows where it landed??? It’s also possible the mail server will choose not to hand it off to the email account, but that’s not as likely since most mail servers would prefer to outright reject the email and provide that feedback to the sender..You know..like when the postal carrier marks your package as ""delivered"" in their system, but it's nowhere to be found in your mailbox so you start hunting around your doorstep and asking neighbors if they got it by mistake, but it’s nowhere to be found ? (sorry..went off on a tangent there!) A good Delivery rate is 98%+ Because – what’s the alternative? The opposite of Delivered is Undelivered… meaning it didn’t get delivered AT ALLIt failed or bounced or got rejected by the receiving mail server – none of those are what we wantNOTE: Delivered is a stat MOST email marketing tools DO NOT share with you! Why? Because they’d have to answer to itInstead, they show how many people went into a campaign or automation, then skip right over Delivered and just show the Open rateFor those using Mailgun with Highlevel, every stat is visibleSo, unlike other email tools, Highlevel lets you have full visibility into your delivery rates, and direct communication with your own SMTP provider, which means the power is entirely in your hands to get the best possible results from your email marketing effortsTHIS is why I love the Highlevel/Mailgun combination so much! No other email toolset gives this much opportunity for excellent deliverability*DELIVERABILITY* Unlike Delivery, Deliverability is a stat you don’t see anywhereDeliverability = Inbox Placement… in other words your Inboxing Rate – how much of your email hits the Inbox vsother folders (like Spam or Junk or Promotions…) or not delivering at allEmail Service Providers do not provide this level of detail in their feedback loops, so we don’t actually see stats related to which folders our email is landing in - only if it was deliveredA Good Deliverability rate would obviously be ?% Although, there’s no such thing as 100% to the inbox, every time, it’s important to understand some of the factors that play into it, so we can come as close to 100% as possibleThings like: IP and domain reputation Reputation is KEY! Many, many things affect reputation, but there are 2 main categories that weigh heavily… Volume and Consistency, and the almighty Engagement (opens, clicks, replies, bounces, complaints, unsubscribes)For more information on stats, check out “What Email Deliverability Stats Should I Look For?”Individual Email Service Provider (ESP) filtering preferences Google, Yahoo!, Outlook, etc- they don’t all filter exactly the same… There are 100s of things that play into email deliverability, but none of these companies provide a whitepaper with their filtering logic Authentication Those pesky DNS records - the SPFs, DKIMs, and DMARCs of the worldAnd don’t forget your MX records… if those aren’t configured correctly that could also land you in spam or even prevent deliveryDomain age Whether it’s a root domain or a subdomain, age factors into warm-up considerationsTreat your new domain like a first date… the goal being to get a second dateWhen you show up at the door with a new domain, you have no history and no reputation, so make sure to start sending slow and don’t rush thingsA good reputation can overcome a young domain ageDomain suffix Some of them have a bad rep from the start! The most trustworthy domain suffixes are .com, .co, .net, and .org (.edu and .gov for those who can use them) There are others that work well and some that can send you directly to the spam folderSee how your domain suffix rates hereSubject line and body copy What you say, mattersOne time I took the word FREE out of a subject line, and that alone improved Deliverability by 7%! Stay away from known spammy words/phrases like “click here”, “opportunity”, “free”, “100%”, etcBlacklistings The dreaded “Black Spot”There are actually different types of blacklists and different reasons for ending up on oneSome cause huge problems, and some are just temporaryCheck to see if your domain or IP is blacklisted hereLink types, link length, number of links, link reputation Even a simple signature tool can have a dramatic effect on deliverabilityKeep in mind, having a link in your email that’s associated with a blacklist or has a bad reputation makes your email “guilty by association”, so make sure any links used inside your email are ones you trust and/or controlText to HTML ratio There’s a time and a place for “fancy” email templatesThe general rule is 60:40, leaning heavy on the text sideThe audience know/like/trust factor and previous engagement can weigh in on how much HTML you can get away withAlso, it’s important to testIt may be that the heavier HTML, even though decreasing deliverability, may still win on conversionsVolume and consistency How much you send, how fast you send it, and how often you send..All of these factors can affect your domain or IP reputation, which can then affect your deliverabilityThink of what a “spammer” would do… sends a lot, all at once, more interested in just shoving the email out than concerning themselves with nurturing the recipient relationshipDon’t be like a spammer(see Domain Age) Recipient email behavior Believe it or not, how the user interacts with their own email account factors into how your email might be directedLearning to factor recipient behavior into your deliverability strategy will take you much further than most marketersAnd many others..We don’t have control over every factor that plays into Deliverability, but it’s important to isolate the things we CAN control - even if just a little bit, and then just do everything we can to control them entirely*Look for more detailed articles on some of these factors coming soon! Need Some Help? This article touches on a handful of things that affect whether or not your email gets delivered to the Inbox, but there are 100s of things that play into deliverability, and every situation is uniqueProper setup/configuration is necessary to get you TO the inbox, but it’s the behavioral stuff that ensures you STAY thereIt’s virtually impossible to troubleshoot email deliverability issues over a Facebook post, helpdesk chat, or ticketTroubleshooting properly requires an understanding of all the factors and thorough analysis in order to properly troubleshootIf you’re struggling to get your emails to the inbox, or even if you just want to look at ways to turn your email marketing up a notch, please book a call with Krystin at Email2Inbox"

In the ""Path"" field, follow the placeholder example, including a ""/"" in the field followed directly with the new path after the ""/"". The ""Target URL"" needs be a full, valid URL. Redirect Type: Funnel The Funnel redirect, allows you to 301 redirect a url to a step in an existing funnel that is linked with a domain within the subaccount. Redirect Type: website Website redirect allows you to 301 redirect a url to a HighLevel Website page. Only those websites that are linked to a domain can be used here. Redirect Type: ALL Redirect all paths from one URL to all paths of another URL. It is particularly useful when you have a ""www"" domain (www.mydomain.com) and a root domain (mydomain.com) wherein you can keep all of your paths on one website within HighLevel (e.g. mydomain.com/about-us) and then redirect all paths from www.mydomain.com to the root domain, thereby including www.mydomain.com/about-us without having to add a redirect for each path or maintain two websites. *This is also known as a REGEX redirect."

A5: If your workflow management tool supports time zones, you would typically set the Event Start Date/Time in your time zone, and the tool would then adjust it based on each contact's time zoneIf the workflow doesn't have time zone information for a contact, it would typically use your account's time zone by default"
Video Element in Email Builder,"The Video element in Email builder allows you to easily add videos into your emailNote: due to technical limitation of all major email clients, we can not yet embed videos into emailsThe Video block simply creates a preview image (using the video's thumbnail image), adds a play button, and then hyperlinks the image to your video URL so when someone clicks the image, they are taken to the videoOnce you drag n drop a video element into the builder area, you will see the following editor on left hand side and a new video element on right hand with a play button and default thumbnail imageVideo editor The Video editor provides following video configurations Video Type: There are currently 4 options to choose from: YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and HTML5Based on the selected video type, the system will try to fetch the video thumbnail from the video URL and also change the play button styling based on the provider themes (e.gin case of YouTube, the button will appear with a red background and white play icon)The link to the thumbnail image will automatically appear in the ""Video Thumbnail URL"" fieldVideo URL: Here is where you need to enter the URL of your video If the preview fails to fetch the thumbnail image from video, it will display a warning (e.gIf you change the video type to Vimeo for a YouTube video url, the editor will try to fetch the thumbnail based on the Vimeo logic, which will not work so it will show you a warning)NOTE: The Editor will not clear the previously fetched image if it fails to fetch thumbnail image so if you want to add an image that doesn't have a thumbnail image, you could first add a video that has a thumbnail image you like, then change the video URL and thumbnail image from the first video will remainVideo Thumbnail URL: As mentioned above, the editor will try to fetch the default thumbnail image from Video URL based on selected video type and fill this field automatically but you can also provide your own thumbnail image by adding its urlUse the Replace button to upload and provide custom Video thumbnail Use the Remove button to remove the default thumbnail Width & Height: Through these input fields you can control the dimension of your videoIf no dimensions are added, then video will take full width and auto height based on image resolution NOTE: By default, the video element will always be aligned on left hand side if you provide custom Height and widthUnlike with images, it is not possible to align them using the Align attribute but you can align it through padding or wrapping them inside a 2 or 3 column layoutPadding: You can provide the padding to video element through this field see below image to see it in action"

Using custom fonts in the Email Builder,"When creating your own HTML Email Design System, you may want to use a custom font beyond the standard ones available. When working with brand guidelines where you need to use a custom font, it's always best to use a custom font with a solid fallback in place. Email client support The first consideration to take into account when working with custom fonts is that email client support is patchy. The following email clients support custom fonts: Apple Mail iOS Mail Samsung Mail Outlook.com It's important to define a font-stack when using custom fonts. This should include some standard system fonts to make sure that your email renders in clients which don't support custom fonts. 'OpenSansBold', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif To host your custom fonts, you can either use a service such as Google Fonts, or host them yourself. We can also host them for our customers - we'll need to see proof of your license before we can do this. For situations where your custom fonts aren't supported, you should select fallbacks that are included on the majority of computers. These fallbacks define what fonts will be displayed if the email client doesn't support custom fonts. CSS set up The most reliable way to include a specific font into your email is to use @font-face. Below is an example of this in action: <style> @font-face { font-family: 'Festive', cursive; src: url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Festive&display=swap') } * { font-family: 'Festive', cursive; } </style> When working with Outlook, we need to wrap this @font-face in a @media tag. This is because Outlook 2007, 2010 and 2017 don't support them."

Perform a card Auth on your SaaS Checkout pages,"If you are an agency using SaaS Mode on HighLevel, you may wish to protect your SaaS offer from bad actors trying to signup for your SaaS and misusing it. One best practice is to always have a card auth on your SaaS checkout pages. In this article we will discuss how to enable card auth to protect your SaaS offer from bad actors. Old Funnels vs New Funnels Determine if your SaaS Offer is build using old funnels or new funnels and follow the steps below. You can find this information by going to location view -> sites -> funnels and looking at the list. New funnels have a version 2 tag next to the funnel name. Card Auth of Old Funnels Go to your funnel step that contains your SaaS product and go to ""products"" tab Card Auth for New Funnels Go to your funnel step that contains your SaaS product and go to ""products"" tab How does the card authorization work? Card authorization allows your funnels to validate the funds in a card before proceeding to create a subscription. This is especially useful when you offer a free trial for your subscriptions. It deters bad actors from signing up to your platform and allows only real users with sufficient balance to proceed for the free trial. Will my clients be charged for this authorization? No your clients will not be charged for the authorization because it works by creating a payment intent and immediately refunds it before the charges can be settled. It is only a way to know if the card being used is a real card with sufficient balance."

Why was I Charged Immediately after Upgrading? (Proration Explained) We understand that different monetary amounts appearing on your statement can cause concern to our clientsThese changes are often attributed to proration for a modified subscription mid-cycleSince HighLevel is a prepaid service, paying your monthly invoice is for the following/upcoming monthIf you upgrade to a higher-tiered plan mid-cycle, you gain access to the new features of that plan type right away! Since this is being applied before the next billing date, HighLevel has to adjust pro-rata for the period you were still using the lower-tiered planTo do so, we calculate the per-day amount owed for the lower-tiered planThis amount is multiplied by the number of days under that plan, then deducted from the total amount to be paid for the higher-tiered planHere is an example: Cost of Lower tiered plan: $297 Cost of Higher tiered plan: $497 Last Billing Date: March 5th Current Billing Date: March 15th Number of Days lower-tiered plan was used: 10 days Credits: $297 - [($297/30) X 10] = $198 Noof Day Remaining: 20 Amount to be Billed: [($497/30) X 20] - $198 = $133.33 Next Billing Date: May 5th How Do I Modify My HighLevel Subscription? We require you to fill out our billing funnel to finalize your subscription-related requestYou can do this by accessing the following; 1) Agency Settings 2) Agency Billing 3) Select the ""click here"" button next to modify or cancel Please section located in the middle of your screen (as shown in the screenshot)If you do not see the ""click here"" option on your billing page, kindly open a chat explaining your request insteadRemember, if you have any additional feedback, requests, or notes, please list them in the ""Feedback"" field of the funnelHow Do I Upgrade my HighLevel Account?

destination, and even if it does, the recipient won't be able to respondSimilarly, a sender address verification error can occur in email communication if the recipient server fails to locate the sending domain's necessary MX records (Mail Exchanger records)Here's how the problem usually manifests itself: 550 Verification failed for <bounce+c72392.3559d@yoursendingdomain.com>\nUnrouteable

current Mailgun sending domain: If you're using a subdomain: Although not required, we highly recommend pointing your MX records for the domain to MailgunThis helps prevent Sender Verification ErrorsSet the MX records for the subdomain to Mailgun values to fix the errorThese are: Value: mxa.mailgun.org, Priority: 10 Value: mxb.mailgun.org, Priority: 10 Wait 24-48 hours for the records to propagate fully, and the error should disappearIf you still see the error, try adjusting the domain in the From field of the message to match the sending domainIf you're using a root domain: If your root domain already has your Email Service Provider's (ESP's) MX records in place, the best solution is to add a subdomain for your Mailgun sendingThe error should be resolved once you've added the subdomain and configured Mailgun's MX recordsPlease Note: If your root domain doesn't have or needs MX records pointing to a hosted mailbox provider, you can add the root domain to your Mailgun account, verify the required TXT AND MX records, and send through the root domainRemember: Only point your MX records for a domain to one source to avoid email misdirection or loss3Alternate Approaches: If the error persists after trying the above steps, consider these alternatives: Turn off sender address verification (on the server side with your email provider)Create a ""catch-all"" within the configuration of your email providerThis ensures that Sender Address Verification will pass when the recipient server checks the sender information for incoming emailsUnderstanding and troubleshooting these kinds of issues can be technical, but following these steps should help you resolve sender verification errorsThis Mailgun article has more informationToo many requests The error

Google My Business Publishing Troubleshooting,"While publishing to GMB, please make sure you do the following: 1. Choose the ideal aspect image ratio: Image can help for social engagement towards your business audience. Google map allows you to add images in your list which represent the product to people and how it looks. They have certain recommended practices regarded as an image ratio. The images should be of JPG or PNG format The picture's size must be between 10 KB to 5MB The minimum image's resolution should be 250x250. The photo should be related to the product. We would recommend avoiding posting irrelevant photos. 2. The GMB location must be verified for a post to be successfully published. It is necessary for your post to be successfully published on GMB that the location is verified. After completing the listing of your location, you must have verified your business location in Google My Business and check the location's status by clicking on the Manage location or in Social Planner, in the section of Type with verified or unverified option. 3. Are you posting to a Google My Business listing that has more than 10 locations? Sadly it is not possible, Google My business hasn't allowed its users to post more than 10 locations. If you added more than 10 locations then you'll receive a message from the GMB ""This location belongs to a chain. The Local Post API is disabled for this location"". This particular error occurs when Google My Business doesn't allow you to post through its API. According to the guidelines, any brand with equal to or more than 10 locations is not eligible for posting. To resolve this, please make sure that you have only selected less than 10 locations for each brand while integrating."

Call Status Workflow Trigger Setup,"Two ways to capture Call results: 1. Call Connect feature This feature requires that the receiver press a key in order to connect the call, this will result in higher accuracy for call reporting. After you enable this option, you will need to update the whisper message as this feature requires that the receiver press a key to connect the call. 2. Call timeout If you don't want to use the Call connect feature, you can adjust the Incoming Call Timeout according to how soon the forwarding number's voicemail answers. We recommend using a Call Timeout of 20 seconds or lower depending on your forwarding number. E.g. If your forwarding number's voicemail answers within 15 seconds, set the Call Timeout to 10 seconds so it will drop the Call forwarding before it reaches your voicemail. This will mark the Call as answered because we are not able to know if it's a human or a voicemail answering the call. You can upload your own voicemail here.

operations that can be performed on it: Purpose: The current date field represents the current date and time according to the timezone of your sub-accountIt can be used to compare and calculate dates about the present momentData Format: The current date field typically stores information in a standardized format like YYYY-MM-DD or includes time information (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM: SS)It can also be displayed according to different time zones or locale-specific formatsSupported Math Operations for Current Date Field: Add/Subtract Days: Description: Add or subtract a specific number of days to/from the current dateUse Cases: Calculate deadlines or follow-up dates based on the current date, determine the end date of a trial period, or compute the date for a future task or eventAdd/Subtract Months: Description: Add or subtract a specific number of months to/from the current dateUse Cases: Calculate the next billing date for a subscription service starting from the current date, compute the date for a recurring monthly event, or determine the end date of a lease or contract about the present momentAdd/Subtract Years: Description: Add or subtract a specific number of years to/from the current dateUse Cases: Calculate the renewal date for an annual membership or license starting from the current date, determine the date of a future milestone or anniversary, or project future financial data based on historical trends and the current dateBy leveraging math operations on the current date field, you can create workflows that are adaptable and responsive to the present momentThis enables you to automate time-sensitive tasks, generate timely reminders, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your business processesApplying Negative Values to Math Operations: Applying these constraints when performing Math Operations within workflows can be important based on the specific characteristics of monetary and numeric fieldsHere are some examples of where these constraints could apply: Please Note: Negative values are not supported with Date or Current Date fieldsMonetary Field Constraints: Use Case: Calculating discounts for a product or serviceIf the discount applied results in a negative value, the system should update the final price to 0 instead of a negative number, ensuring customers do not get charged a negative amountSolution: When performing Math Operations on monetary fields, it's essential to ensure that any subtraction operation that could result in a negative value is checked with an If/Else conditionIf the result is negative, update the monetary field to 0Numeric Field Constraints: Use Case: Calculating the net profit or loss for a businessIn this case, the numeric field can store positive and negative values, representing profit or lossSolution: When performing Math Operations on numeric fields, one can directly add or subtract values without additional constraints, as negative values are allowedUsing If/Else conditions and other actions to ensure the constraints are respected can benefit workflowsFor example, if a Math Operation on a monetary field results in a negative value, an If/Else condition can be used to check the result and set the value to 0 if necessary, thus maintaining the constraint for monetary fieldsFAQs Can I perform multiple math operations in a single workflow step? Answer: No, each Math Operation action in a workflow allows you to perform a single math operation simultaneouslyHowever, you can add multiple Math Operation actions in sequence within the same workflow to perform more complex calculationsHow do I handle rounding errors or decimal precision when performing math operations? Answer: Most systems automatically handle decimal precision when performing math operationsHowever, if you need more control over rounding, consider adding custom logic or rounding functions in your workflow to ensure the desired level of precisionCan I perform math operations on custom date fields? Answer: Yes, you can perform math operations on custom date fieldsThis allows you to add or subtract days, months, or years to/from custom date fields, making it easy to automate time-based calculations and scheduling tasks tailored to your business needsAre there any limitations on my range of values in math operations? Answer: The range of values you can use in math operations depends on the field type and the system's capabilitiesFor monetary fields, the minimum value is 0, whereas numeric fields can store both positive and negative valuesCan I use the result of a math operation in an If/Else condition? Answer: Absolutely! You can use the result of a Math Operation action as a condition in an If/Else action to create dynamic workflows that route leads or perform specific actions based on the calculated valuesFor example: We can use the lead scores you calculated in If/Else conditions to route leads to different paths based on specific conditionsThis allows you to tailor the lead's journey through the sales funnel based on their level of interest in the business, as determined by their lead scoreOther Usage Cases for If/else conditions with Math Operations: Renewal reminders: Subtract the current date from the subscription renewal date, and if the difference is less than or equal to a specific number of days (e.g., 14), send a renewal reminder email to the customerSales commission calculations: Calculate the commission for a salesperson using Math Operations based on their sales revenueIf the commission amount exceeds a certain threshold, assign them to a high-performing group and send them a congratulatory emailTime-sensitive promotions: Add a specific number of days to the current dateIf the resulting date falls within a promotional period, offer customers a special discount or incentiveCustomer segmentation based on spending: Calculate the total spending of a customer using Math OperationsIf the spending exceeds a certain threshold, classify them as high-value customers and send targeted offersEmail campaign performance: Calculate an email campaign's open rate and click-through rateIf these metrics surpass specific benchmarks, trigger a follow-up campaign for engaged subscribersProject deadline monitoring: Subtract the current date from the project deadline, and if the difference is less than or equal to a specific number of days, send a reminder to the team members to complete their tasksPerformance-based bonuses: Calculate an employee's performance score using Math Operations based on their achievementsIf their score exceeds a predefined threshold, award them a bonus and congratulate themInventory management: Calculate the remaining stock of a product by subtracting the sold quantity from the initial stockIf the remaining stock falls below a specific level, trigger a reorder or notify the purchasing departmentCan math operations be performed using data from external sources, such as APIs? Answer: While the primary focus of Math Operation actions in workflows is on built-in numeric and date fields, some systems may allow you to incorporate data from external sources using custom fields or integrationsThis enables you to perform calculations using data from external APIs or other systemsCan I use Math Operation actions in combination with other workflow actions and triggers? Answer: Yes, Math Operation actions can be combined with other actions, triggers, and conditions in your workflowsThis allows you to create more complex and tailored business processes that automate calculations, data manipulation, and decision-making based on your needs"

How does Notification for Expired Social Accounts in Social Planner works?,"Social Planner lists all the social accounts like Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin and GMB. Every social account have different expiry token timelines. If your Social Account is disconnected, then publishing and analysing content for your page and account will come to a halt. That is why make sure that all your social accounts' access is authorised. When you authorise a page, the access token is automatically created. Each social media platform's authorisation has a different expiration date. For instance, Linkedin has 60 days and Facebook has 90 days limit. Conversely, other networks do not have any expiration time. It is necessary for the users to reconnect the account based on notification or by visiting the Social Planner settings. How will we get notified if the social account token is expired? When the social account token's gets expired, the user will get notified based on their user selected and number of days the email will go out to the user mentioned about reconnecting the mentioned social account. If the user after setup is completed, it will send to the users and email reminders. If there are changes made to number of day for reminder after initial setup, it will be applicable for next time when the social account gets expired."

Go to your WP Admin view 2. Click on Plugins 3. Click on Add New 4. Search for WP File Manager. Select the one shown in the gif above. 5. Install and activate it.

Email Authentication - DMARC,"Starting February 2024, Gmail and Yahoo will require DKIM and DMARC authentication for emailsWe strongly recommends all senders set up DKIM and DMARCFor more details, check our blog post on Google and Yahoo authentication changes in 2024TABLE OF CONTENTS What is DMARC? What is DMARC Record? How does DMARC work? Resolving DMARC Email Failures for Users on LC Email Shared Domains What is DMARC? DMARC, or Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance, is a technical tool that verifies emails by combining SPF and DKIM methodsIt's free to use and helps prevent email fraud like phishingIntroduced in 2012, it enables domain owners to specify how unauthorized use of their email domains should be managed through a policy in the DMARC record (p=)P = NONE Monitors your email trafficNo further actions are takenP = QUARANTINE Sends unauthorized emails to the spam folderP = REJECT The final policy and the ultimate goal of implementing DMARCThis policy ensures that unauthorized email doesn’t get delivered at allWhat is DMARC Record? A DMARC record, housed in a TXT-type DNS entry named _dmarc, outlines policies and preferences for email serversIt's composed of tags assigned with values separated by semicolonsHere's an example of a basic DMARC record: v=DMARC1; p=none; Here are the key tags used in setting up a DMARC record: v (DMARC Version): Default: DMARC1 Translation: Denotes the DMARC protocol versionMust always be set as ""DMARC1""If missing or incorrect, the entire DMARC record is ignoredp (Policy): Default: none Translation:Specifies the action for emails failing DMARC checksnone: Collects feedback without impacting existing flowsquarantine: Treats suspicious emails, often directed to the spam folderreject: Rejects all failing emails outrightadkim (DKIM Alignment Mode): Default: r Translation:Specifies the alignment mode for DKIM signatures""r"" (Relaxed Mode): Allows DKIM domains sharing a common Organizational Domain to pass""s"" (Strict Mode): Requires an exact match between DKIM and email header-From domainsaspf (SPF Alignment Mode): Default: r Translation: Similar to adkim but for SPF authentication""r"" (Relaxed Mode): Allows SPF domains sharing a common Organizational Domain to pass""s"" (Strict Mode): Requires an exact match between SPF and email header-From domainssp (Sub-domain Policy): Default: p= value Translation: Allows explicit publishing of a policy for sub-domains under this DMARC recordfo (Forensic Reporting Options): Default: 0 Translation: Determines conditions for generating forensic reports""0"": Generates reports if all underlying authentication mechanisms fail to produce a DMARC pass result""1"": Generates reports if any mechanisms fail""d"": Generates reports if DKIM signature fails""s"": Generates reports if SPF failsruf (URI for Forensic Reports): Default: none Translation: Specifies where to send Forensic reports (URIs in the form of ""mailto:address@example.org"")rua (URI for XML Feedback): Default: none Translation: Specifies where to send XML feedback reports (URIs in the form of ""mailto:address@example.org"")rf (Reporting Format for Forensic Reports): Default: afrf Translation: Determines the reporting format for individual Forensic reportspct (Percentage): Default: 100 Translation: Specifies the percentage of email failures for which the policy should be appliedThe policy must be ""quarantine"" or ""reject"" for the percentage tag to be appliedri (Reporting Interval): Default: 86400 Translation: Sets the frequency of receiving aggregate XML reportsEach tag serves a specific role in defining DMARC policies and mechanisms for authentication and feedback, ensuring email security and proper handling of failed checksFor assistance in creating a DMARC record, utilizing a DMARC generator tool is recommendedHow does DMARC work? Authentication: SPF/DKIM Check: Receiving servers verify SPF or DKIM authentication methodsDomain Alignment: Validates if the SPF domain (Return-Path) or DKIM domain (d=) aligns with the ""From"" domain in the email headerDMARC Policy: Extracts and enforces the DMARC policy from the DNS record of the ""From"" domainExample Configurations: If SPF passes and aligns with the ""From"" domain, DMARC authentication passes`v=DMARC1; p=none; aspf=r;` If DKIM passes and aligns with the ""From"" domain, DMARC authentication passes`v=DMARC1; p=none; adkim=s;` If both SPF and DKIM fail, DMARC authentication fails`v=DMARC1; p=reject;` Alignment Modes: Relaxed (r) Mode: Allows subdomains in SPF/DKIM checks, comparing them to the ""From"" domainStrict (s) Mode: Requires exact matching of SPF/DKIM domains with the ""From"" domainReporting: Aggregate Reports: Include pass/fail results in periodic aggregate reports sent via specified email addresses using rua tagForensic Reports: Detailed failure reports sent to specified addresses (ruf), but many providers avoid sending these due to sensitive information concernsReporting Interval (ri): Determines the frequency of sending aggregate XML reportsExample Configurations: Sending aggregate reports every 24 hours: `v=DMARC1; p=none; rua=mailto:postmaster@mydomain.com; ri=86400;` Sending forensic reports every 7 days: `v=DMARC1; p=none; ruf=mailto:postmaster@mydomain.com; ri=604800;` Conformance (Policy): DMARC Policy (p): Defines how servers handle failed DMARC checksPercentage (pct): Specifies the percentage of message traffic subject to DMARC verificationExample Configurations: Starting with a quarantine policy and 50% verification for testing: `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; pct=50;` Later, switching to a reject policy and removing the pct tag for full enforcement: `v=DMARC1; p=reject;` Each configuration serves to authenticate emails and define policies for handling failures while allowing flexibility in reporting and enforcement levels based on the sender's requirements and verification stagesResolving DMARC Email Failures for Users on LC Email Shared Domains DMARC is not required to send emails from the shared domains on LeadConnector email systemWhen you switched to LC email system or not configured your own mailgun / SMTP all your email will be sent through LC shared domainThe error message says: ""The domain in your from address (kate@gohighlevel.com) has a p=reject DMARC policyWithout a dedicated sending domain configured, most inbox providers will reject your messages, resulting in elevated bouncesTo avoid elevated bounces, use company emails."" Your actual DMARC record is: v=DMARC1; p=reject"" To fix the issue, Temporarily change your DMARC record with your DNS to have a p=none policy The DMARC error message above has a p=reject or p=quarantineThis will prevent emails that fail DMARC to be sent to the Inbox folderTo make sure messages are delivered even if DMARC fails, you will want to change the policy in your DMARC to p=none with your DNS providerMoving to a more relaxed policy is not recommended so this change should be temporary"

A loom with instructions will be added soonPlease check back in a few daysI am paying both LC Communications and my previous provider (Twilio or Mailgun/SMTP)What can I do? By design LC Communications (LC Phone & LC Email) are enabled for your clients at this point moving forwardThis means in most cases your old clients would still be on the old provider (Twilio for calls, SMS, and Mailgun/SMTP for emails)In this transition period, it is likely that you will be invoiced by HighLevel for the usage that happens on LC Communications and also by Twilio, Mailgun, or other SMTP providers for usage resulting from old sub-accounts that still use themThe easiest way to resolve this situation is to move all your existing clients over to LC Phone & LC Email and close out your accounts with other providersPlease Note: Certain assets like call recordings do not migrate overSo if you need access to call recordings or logs for compliance or HIPAA regulations, you may want to keep operating your Twilio account in a dormant wayWhat happens if a payment fails? If the sms and email charges are left unpaid, we stop all outbound emails and smsWhat happens to my balance if I cancel? We could refund the credit to the credit card linked in the agency accountMy wallet has a balance but I cannot send sms and email? The balance needs to be at least 50% of the amount set for ""when balance is lower than"" for lc phones and emailsBut the rule has been set up where if it's less than 50% it will stop all outbound emails and SMSIf your agency is sending large volume, to avoid not being able to send SMS and email when the balance is low, please increase the number here so when the balance is lower than 50$ so it will auto recharge sooner! For example, if the amount set for ""when balance is lower than"" is $10, the current wallet balance needs to be more than $5 to send outbound emails/smsThis is to safeguard the account from going negativeThe balance in the usage summary doesn't make sense? Why is it dropping to $16.97 from $18.66 after a SMS transaction of 0.00711? In the Phone Numbers ➝ Usage Summary page which shows Agency transactions for that subaccount, the wallet balance for the agency is used across all the subaccounts, so the wallet balance will follow a sequence when we look at a particular subaccountE.gone SMS got charged for subaccount A and another call for subaccount B and then again SMS for A So transactions went like A: SMS1 ➝ $0.01 ➝ Balance: $9.99 B: Call1 ➝ $0.02 ➝ Balance: $9.97 A: SMS2 ➝ $0.01 ➝ Balance: $9.96 So when we view transactions under, it will show transactions just for subaccount A as A: SMS1 ➝ $0.01 ➝ Balance: $9.99 A: SMS2 ➝ $0.01 ➝ Balance: $9.96 and when viewed for B it will show B: Call1 ➝ $0.02 ➝ Balance: $9.97 Related Articles Why is my SMS cost so high?

to begin the process through which all contacts that have a Business Name written in the Business Name field will be added to Companies that have that business namePlease Note The business name ignores case sensitivityE.g If a contact has a business name “Burger King” and another contact has “burger king”, one company will be created for Burger King, instead of twoThe business name doesn’t ignore spaces in the business nameE.g If a contact has the business name “BurgerKing” and another contact has “burger king”, two companies will be created for both business namesThe system cannot identify Two differently spelled Business Names as belonging to one companyE.g A contact with the Business Name: 'Ice Cream Sunday"" will not be added to the same company as another contact with the business name: ""Ice Cream Sundae"" Even one alphabet being different would lead to a separate company being created for the contactUpon check marking the Create & Associate companies with contacts check box, you will have the option to save this changeA prompt will ask you whether you would like to proceed with this: Upon clicking Yes, All contacts that have their Business Name field filled out in the General Info Section of their contact page will be added to a Company with the same name as the Business NameIf a company of that name does not exist, one will be created for themYou will see a confirmation message if the process successfully starts: The Business Name field is the Unique Identifier in this regardCase Sensitivity is not an issue but Spacing and Spelling are deciding factorsThe following fields if filled out for the contact in the General Info tab would also be automatically mapped into the Company that gets created: Street address City Country State Postal code

company will be created with the business name value present in the contactAnd the contact will be associated with the companyIf the business name and its details are similar in multiple contactsA new company will be created with the business name valueAll contacts will get associated with the newly created companyIf the business name is the same in multiple contacts but its details vary between contactsA new company will be created with the business name valueAll contacts will get associated with the newly created company.The below details will be considered for the latest contact createdStreet address City Country State Postal code Website Limitations and Expected Behavior: The setting feature is only available for admin users (agency & sub-account)Team members with the User Role will not have the ability to begin the migration processPlease Note: Users with User Role will still see the setting, they just would not be able to do anything to itOnce the automation settings are turned on, it will migrate all the existing contacts with business nameOnce the migration is completed, it will automatically sync new contacts with business name field valueIf a contact has a company associated with it already, it will not be migrated to a different company even if the Business Name is different at the time when the process is startedThe migration for existing contacts can only happen if the contact doesn’t have any association with a companyPlease Note: Changing the Business Name for contacts already added to a Company will have no impact on the AutomationIf the automation settings are turned off, the auto sync or the migration will stopUpon turning on the migration or auto sync will beginThe following Audit logs for all the activities are present for this featureWho is the User who initiated the settings optionWhich Contact got updated with company associationCompany creationCompany updateIf the settings are turned off in between existing contact migration and restarted, it will start the migration process from where it stopped and complete for the remaining contactsThe feature is applicable for contacts added by bulk import, public API, forms, etcIt will live sync between business name and companyPlease Note: The CSV file being imported must have a column with the Column Header ""Business Name"", and the respective Business Names must be filled out for contacts for the contacts to get added into a company upon being imported into the CRM(Provided that the Company Object Automation is enabled)If you make any errors during the import and the wrong Company gets associated to the contacts with misspelled Business Name or spacing in the Business Name that does not match the Business Name for the Company, then you will need to delete the contacts that have the issue and re-import the CSV with the correct Business Name.(Any data lost due to the deletion will not be recovered because the contact is not being restored, a new version of the contact is being created) This process doesn’t have backward compatibilityOnce a company is created based on the business name, any change in the company name or its details doesn’t reflect back on the Business Name field and other synced fields in the contact's General InfoThis doesn’t support business name update functionalityWhich means once a company is created using business name, any update in business name will not affect the company attributes or its relation with the contactPlease Note: The Company Object automation only serves to associate existing or new contacts, THAT ARE NOT LINKED TO A COMPANY ALREADY, with Companies that share the same Business NameIf no such company exists then a company with that Business Name will be created"
Standard Triggers - Order Submitted,"The Order Submitted trigger is a powerful new workflow trigger that allows businesses to upsell customers after they have submitted an orderThis trigger works with both 1 Step and 2-Step order forms, giving businesses the flexibility to customize their upsells based on the type of order form used or types of products purchasedCovered in this Article: When does the Order Submitted trigger fire? How is it different from the Order Form Submitted Workflow Trigger? Using an Email Template to send an Order Confirmation via this Workflow How do submission types filters work? Will this trigger impact existing Order form submission triggers? What are the filter types, if/else conditions, and custom values I can use? When does the Order Submitted trigger fire? Please Note Make sure that the Allow Multiple Setting is toggled on in the Workflow Settings if you want it to fire off for the same contact for an Upsell, right after it fires off for them for a Primary Product's purchaseIf you put in a wait step which holds the first instance (which came from the purchase of the primary product) of the customer in the workflow, and they go ahead and purchase the upsell, since they would still be held inside the workflow, the Upsell purchase will not let them enter the workflow a second timeTry to avoid using wait steps in this workflow, feel free to use them if you do not plan on selling Upsells or Bumps for the same productThe trigger runs upon a 1-Step or 2-Step order form submission and upsellsThis trigger runs both when an order form is submitted, and again when an upsell purchase occurs; on either of these occasions it holds the product informationThis means that if the end customer purchases products A and B on an order form and product C on an upsell, it will run two times (first for A and B purchase, and then for the upsell purchase) Please note: This only works with version 2 funnels(Check out this article for more details on V2 Funnels) If you are using a version 1 funnel, please upgrade to version 2 using the button shown below: How is it different from the Order Form Submitted Workflow Trigger? The following are the most significant differences between the Order Submitted and the Order Form Submitted Workflow Triggers: The trigger does not run multiple times on multiple product purchasesThe trigger contains a single checkout object sending info only a single time upon an order form submission, Even if that one order session consists of buying multiple productsAbility to filter the trigger directly on the basis of the global product/priceThe existing trigger does not provide this functionality Ability to use order-related custom values inside the workflowThis contains custom values related to customers, order details, coupon information, and payment gateway Please Note: These Custom values will not show up in the custom values drop down unless the Order Submitted Trigger is one of the workflow trigger stepsUse conditions related to order details or product details in the If branches to direct the workflow based on the cart value/products purchased/funnel Using an Email Template to send an Order Confirmation via this Workflow The products purchased by a client can be populated using the Shopping Cart element on an email builder template and using that specific template to send out a confirmation email to the end customerThe Shopping Cart element will auto-populate the product line items along with the purchased quantities, product images, and line item pricesPlease Note: The Shopping Cart element will also populate the product images added in the Payments ➝ Products pageIn case no image is added for the product, the element will populate the default image on its ownIt is highly recommended to use custom product images while making use of the shopping cart element to avoid any default system-generated imagesAll you would need to make sure is that the Shopping cart element is added to Template, and the same template is added to the workflow in the Send Email action for the values to populate properlyHow do submission types filters work? Primary - Filters if any primary product is purchased at the checkout on the order formBump - Filters only if a bump product has been purchased on the order formThe trigger would not work if no bump product has been purchased Upsell - Filters only in case of upsell purchasesIf the filter is set to upsell, the trigger would not run on an order form submission (purchase of a primary/bump product) Will this trigger impact existing Order form submission triggers? No, this should not make any changes to an existing order form submission triggerHowever, we recommend using the Order submitted trigger to make use of the order-related custom values along with coupon information and product line itemsWhat are the filter types, if/else conditions, and custom values I can use? Trigger Filter Operators Selectable items Order submission 1 Product is, is not Global product name 1a Price is, is not Price Name 2 Order Source is, is not Order form 2a Submission Type is, is not Primary, Bump, Upsell 3 Funnel is, is not Funnel names 3a Page is, is not Page inside funnel 3b Product is, is not Funnel level products If/Else Filter Operators Selectable Items A Order Source is, is not Order form B Product is, is not Global product C Payment Gateway is, is not Stripe, Paypal D Order Total Numeric operators Numeric operators E Submission Type is, is not Primary, Bump, Upsell F Funnel is, is not Funnel names Custom Value Category Custom Value Order Currency symbol ($) Currency code (USD) Cart Total Order total Coupon code Total discount Created on Created at Order ID Payment Gateway Custom Value Category Custom Value Order>Customer ID First Name Last Name Name Email Phone Full Address City State Country Postal Code"

Please Note Split testing will only be possible once you have added a domain to your funnelFirst, Navigate to Sites> Funnels (or Websites) > Go to the Funnel (or Website) that you want to do a split test withChoose the desired Funnel Step in which you want to create a split testClick on Create VariationPlease Note making noticeable changes to the Variation helps to make the Split Test more productiveIf barely noticeable differences exist between the Control and the Variation then the Split test will not be an accurate representation of which step is betterPlease avoid making changes to the Control while the Split test is running so you can get a more accurate picture of which variant is betterOnce you have chosen one of the three options, you can move a Slider to decide what percentage of traffic you want to divert to the Control Page and what percentage to the VariationOnce that is decided, you can click Start Split TestIt will then ask you for confirmation about the changes that have been madeClick on Apply to proceedPlease Note Even though all the traffic is brought to your page's URL, it is then split as per the Split Test Slider towards the dedicated URLs for the Control Page and the Variation PageYou can edit the dedicated URLs for the Control and the variation by clicking on the Gear Icon below themGear Icon below the Control Page lets you edit its dedicated URL PathThe Gear Icon below the Variation lets you edit its dedicated URL PathSplit tests work via browser cookies, so once you open the main URL, a cookie will be attached to you for whichever variant appearsIf you (while doing a test for yourself) would like to see the other Variation, open the URL again in an incognito tab or another browser altogetherSplit Test Results As traffic begins to flow to the Page, the result of the Split Test will begin to populate between the two variantsYou can view detailed Stats for the Split Test by clicking on the Stats tab above the Page and then clicking on the Page you are running the Split Test on to expand a dropdown of stats on the Control and the VariationFAQ Q1All the traffic goes only to the control page, and nothing goes to the variation pagePlease ensure that the domain advertised on your ads is the same as for the funnel step for which you run the Split TestIf people are being routed to your root domain (or subdomain) and not visiting your Split Testing page's domain, then the Split Test will not workAn easy way to ensure this would be to make your root domain's default page be marked as the Page you are running the Split test onQ2The stats do not match the ratio configured for split testingOne of the links - either the direct link to the control page or the variation page - may be used on a page on another funnel or an ad that skips split testing logicMaking some percentage of visitors be routed to that other PageSo the numbers will look skewedQ3Google Ads/FB Ads policies conflict with Path URL redirectionThis happens in Split tests; how do I work around this? At times, Google Ads and Facebook Ads policies do not permit the use of path URL redirection in split testsIn this situation, a workaround is to conduct the split test on the second step of your sales funnel insteadYou can direct leads from your Google and Facebook Ads to the first step of the funnel, which can contain educational material to engage the lead and keep them interested until they take the next step in the funnelBy doing this, you can avoid breaking any ad redirect policiesIn essence, you are separating the split test from the lead acquisition process, allowing you to gather data on which ad version performs better without violating policiesThis workaround enables you to run split tests compliantly and gather valuable insights for optimizing your ad campaigns"

Here are some steps you can take to mitigate nuisance labels, blocked calls, or call filtering associated with your phone number: US Numbers: Register your US numbers with the FCCThey have a free registry site, https://www.freecallerregistry.com/fcr/, which liaises with major analytic companies supporting key US wireless carriersRegistering can help remove a negative label on your callInternational Numbers: Currently, we cannot assist with nuisance labels for international numbersWe suggest contacting the terminating carrier marking your calls as spam and working with them directlyCNAM registration: Updating or adding CNAM might increase call answers by offering accurate caller information, though it won't affect nuisance labelsCNAM is a feature in the United States public telephone network that identifies an incoming caller by a personal or business name associated with the calling partyNote: CNAM doesn't remove nuisance labels, but accurate caller information can enhance answer ratesSetting up SHAKEN/STIR: SHAKEN/STIR is a set of protocols designed to authenticate caller ID information and verify that it is coming from a legitimate sourceThe protocol works by using digital certificates to validate the caller's identityWhen a call is made, the caller's identity is verified through these certificates, which are then stored in an online databaseThis ensures that when someone receives a call, they can trust that it is coming from who they think it isNote: SHAKEN/STIR won't remove nuisance labels but may boost answer rates due to the ""Trusted Call"" labelHow to Apply for SHAKEN/STIR After submitting their Business Profile, Agency and Sub-account admins can register for SHAKEN/STIR1Click on Shaken/STIR (Voice) > Click on Start Registration 2Fill out Business Details, if your brand is already approved, you don't have to fill this out 3Fill out Business Address 4Fill out Authorized Rep details 5Submit registration 6You will get the success message for the submissionThe approval might take up to 4 daysFAQ How will phone numbers be linked to the SHAKEN/STIR Profile? All numbers will be Linked AutomaticallyAll current available numbers and future bought numbers will automatically be linked with the registered SHAKEN/STIRHow can it be that even though the client is A2P and Shaken/Stir approved with a verified caller ID setup, the business name does not show up when making calls? To display the business name, it would be the CNAM Registration, a new feature that's coming soonThe verified caller ID feature only changes the Twilio number to display as the actual business number or the client's personal cell phoneWill registering my number fix mislabeled calls? While registration often rectifies mislabeling, it's not foolproofRegistered numbers can still be flagged based on suspicious call patterns or consumer reportsThus, we advise: Monitoring call behavior for unusual traffic spikesAdhering to TCPA laws, FCC regulations, and our Acceptable Use PolicyShould I register numbers I just acquired? AbsolutelyNuisance labels aren't auto-removed when a number's previous ownership changesAlways register new numbersExplore more on the LC Phone System Trust Center here"

How List-Unsubscribe helps email deliverability,"Covered in this article: What is the list-unsubscribe header? Why list-unsubscribe header is good for email deliverability Can this be disabled? Why I'm not getting the unsubscribe option in the email header What is the list-unsubscribe header? The list-unsubscribe header is an additional ‘unsubscribe’ link generated by some of the most common email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.). When list-unsubscribe instructions are detected in the email header, it allows email recipients to remove their email addresses from your distribution list without searching for the unsubscribe link in your email. Why list-unsubscribe header is good for email deliverability This feature is a deliverability best practice! It helps reduce complaints by giving subscribers a quick method to safely unsubscribe without negatively impacting your sending reputation. It is an additional, preferred option that recipients can use – rather than report spam or an abuse complaint. Can this be disabled? No, this cannot be disabled, as this is an RFC/industry standard. Why I'm not getting the unsubscribe option in the email header The unsubscribe option is only shown for senders with a high reputation. This only works for some senders right now. We're actively encouraging senders to support auto-unsubscribe — we think 100% should. We won't provide the unsubscribe option on messages from spammers: we can't trust that they'll actually unsubscribe you, and they might even send you more spam. So you'll only see the unsubscribe option for senders that we're pretty sure are not spammers and will actually honor your unsubscribe request. We're being pretty conservative about which senders to trust in the beginning; over time, we hope to offer the ability to unsubscribe from more emails."

How do I prevent my messages from being filtered by carriers(30007)?,"Message filtering refers to the blocking of messages that are unwanted or illicitFiltering may occur to enforce LC - Phone Messaging Policy, or to comply with regulations and wireless carriers’ messaging policiesThis article is about steps and specific guidelines to reduce the risk of messages being filteredFor general information about message filtering, see How Does Message Filtering Work? The best way to prevent your messages from being filtered is to follow the guidelines in LC - Phone Messaging Policy, LC Phone System Trust Center, A2P 10DLC Campaign Approval Best Practices and avoid sending spam or fraudulent trafficIf your use case is a forbidden use case for messaging in the United States, that will also lead to filtering in the USCheck out Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada If you're sending to more than one country, check the SMS Guidelines for the countries you are sending messages toThese pages are up to date with rules and best practices for each countryBelow are some guidelines that will greatly reduce the chances that your messages will be filteredTABLE OF CONTENTS Consent and opt-in Use case and sender selection Message contents Avoid account takeover I think my messages are being filtered by mistakeWhat can I do? Consent and opt-in Ensure that you only send messages to mobile users who have provided consent (opted-in) to receive messages from youEnsure that your messages clearly identify who is sending the message, and how to opt-outIf you are contacting the same recipients multiple times per month, you do not need to provide opt-out instructions in every message, but you must do it at least once per monthThe opt-out language you include in your messages must include a widely accepted keyword for opt-outIn the US and Canada this is typically STOP, e.g""Reply STOP to unsubscribe."" Using alternative phrases like ""text 2 to opt out"" is not compliant, and will result in filteringIf you are sending messages to users repeatedly over a long period of time, you should check in with your recipients at least once every 18 months to ensure they still want to receive messages from youThe mobile number you are sending messages to may have changed owners, or the recipient may not remember giving consent to receive messages from youYou should process the DNDs dailyOnce a customer deactivates their phone number, you no longer have consent to send to that numberMonitor your opt out, and consumer complaints data for any spike in activityThis is an indicator that there is something that needs corrected in your consent or opt out mechanismsCarriers will start filtering heavily, or completely block traffic as phone numbers receive complaints/high opt out ratesUse case and sender selection Check the SMS Guidelines for the countries you are sending messages toThese pages are up to date with rules and best practices for each countryBefore sending messages to the United States or Canada, ensure that your use case is not among the Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and CanadaIn general, use only as many phone numbers as are required for your businessLC - Phone Messaging Policy forbids ""snowshoeing"" message sending across multiple phone numbers for the purposes of evading message filtering systemsExamples of valid reasons to use multiple phone numbers is having numerous business locations, or matching phone numbers with users in different geographic locationsAll traffic is considered application-to-person (A2P), and the carriers in the country you are sending to may require that this traffic be sent from a short code or from a pre-registered Alphanumeric Sender ID, if availableThese are both ways that carriers can review your messaging use case in advance, and offer better delivery as a resultIn addition, some countries (such as France) have prohibitions against local numbers from that country being used for A2P trafficIn such cases, Alpha Sender ID (if available) or a number from a different country is a good solution for 1-way A2P messagingIf in doubt, check the SMS Guidelines for the countries you are sending messages toIf you are sending abandoned shopping cart messages to users in the US, there are specific compliance requirements – see ""Specific Use Case Requirements"" on the SMS Guidelines page for the US for more detailsMessage contents URL shortening: Do not send links that have been shortened using shared public URL shorteners, such as TinyUrl or free Bitly linksUnited States carrier policies discourage the use of shared public URL shorteners If possible, when sending URLs/links in your messages, use domains that you controlSimilar to the shortened URL guidance above, when sending links it is best to use a URL that is specific to your businessFor example, if you control the domain mybusiness.net, you can be certain that only your business is using this domain, and nobody else could be sending URLs with that domain name that could link to objectionable contentUsing URLs that may also be used by other services/individuals is permitted and is not guaranteed to result in filteringHowever, it increases filtering risk, as another user of that same URL domain could send something spammy or objectionable and get that domain flagged by filtering systemsObfuscated URLs are common in spoofing/phishing attempts, and will be filteredDon’t use emojis, or unnecessary special characters/capitalization, and watch your grammar and spellingTypically, these messages are structured in a way to attempt to evade detection of unwanted messaging, and your messages will be filteredDo not send content that is illegal in your sending area, or is forbidden by carriersSee Forbidden message categories for SMS and MMS in the US and Canada for additional informationI think my messages are being filtered by mistakeWhat can I do?

such as cross-referencing data from multiple sheets or databasesBy leveraging the power of our workflow system, you can reduce errors, increase efficiency, and save time, all while ensuring the accuracy and completeness of your dataWith our lookup functionality, you can easily integrate your Google Sheets documents into your workflow processes, creating powerful data management workflows that help you to drive better outcomesChoose a worksheet: Select a worksheet within your Spreadsheet that you wish to use for Looking up and retrieving dataSelect Search Order: Select in which order the Google Sheet rows should be searched to find the matching rowFrom the top of the Sheet - returns the first matching row From the bottom of the Sheet - returns the most recent matching row Select a Column and Lookup Value to find the matching row The first row is considered Headers, shown as labels for each ColumnYou can fetch the latest headers from the sheet by clicking ""Refresh Headers"".columncolumn Select an extra Column and Lookup ValueIf an extra column is added, then both the Column's values should match to determine the matching rowCreate Spreadsheet row if it doesn't exist yet: If enabled, it will execute Create Spreadsheet Row action when the lookup could not find any matching row at the time of executionThis action will be logged and charged separatelyUsing as Custom Variables: One of the advantages of using Lookup is that when you search for a particular row, all of its data can be saved as a custom value that can be utilized throughout your workflowConsider the following Worksheet as an exampleIf you need to search for a specific row, you can enter the contact phone number or email address in the lookup sectionOnce the lookup function finds the matching row, it will store all the values under the corresponding header name as custom variablesWhen you add a Lookup action, an index is automatically generatedThis index is essential for mapping the row data to the custom variables and allows for easy identification of multiple lookup valuesRemoving or editing the index once it is added is impossibleThe values obtained from the lookup action for a particular row can be used in all other activities within your workflows, just like any other contact fields or custom variablesPlease Note: As previously mentioned, the index generated by the lookup function serves as a reference and is used for internal mapping of the custom variables in lookup actionsYou can use {{sheet.x.rowNumber}} to get the row number of the lookup valueHere x is the index of the lookup actionExample: The custom values of LookedUp Row can be utilized in all of the actions within your workflowSome examples of how to do this are provided belowIn If/Else: Important points to remember: Referencing the Google Sheets Lookup Action cannot find a matching row; all subsequent Google Sheets Actions that reference this Lookup Action will be skipped due to lack of a resultTherefore, consider this when building workflows that include this Lookup Action and the Google Sheets: Update Spreadsheet Row using Lookup or Google Sheets: Delete Spreadsheet Row using

Understanding the Potential Delivery Issues of Text Messages with Shortened URLs,"In simple terms, link tracking helps measure the success of text message campaigns, but it can cause problems for usersPublic shortened URLs often redirect multiple times and don't provide much information about the sender, which can lead to text messages being blockedTo solve this issue, using custom domains that match your website or are familiar to your company's brand is a straightforward solutionInterestingly, T-Mobile has also addressed this problemJust to recap, T-Mobile introduced their Code of Conduct for Commercial Messaging on September 1st, 2020This code lays out T-Mobile's guidelines and expectations for business-related messaging on their networkIf you want to communicate with someone using a T-Mobile-connected device, it's important to follow these new rulesT-Mobile has a preference for using a single, recognizable domain nameAccording to their Code of Conduct, messaging programs should be connected to a business's web domainWhile using the complete domain is preferred, using a branded short URL is acceptable for delivering custom linksThis helps maintain consistency with consumers, enhances brand awareness, and boosts confidence in the linksT-Mobile has more to say about URLsIn their section on ""Prohibited Messaging Practices,"" they have two rules related to URLs: They prohibit the use of URL cycling to bypass spam filtersThis means that public URL shorteners like bit.ly or rb.gy are likely to be blocked, preventing messages containing those URLs from being deliveredT-Mobile discourages the use of URLs that redirect multiple timesSuch URLs can hide the actual website destination from consumers, potentially leading to fraudulent websitesT-Mobile's spam filters specifically check for URLs with multiple redirects, and messages containing them are likely to be blockedIn fact, AT&T has decided to completely block public link shorteners due to their association with fraudulent activities and phishing scamsAlthough T-Mobile and others haven't taken the same stance yet, it would be wise to take steps to improve message deliverability now to prepare for the futureWhat does all of this mean? The efforts to minimize or eliminate the use of public link tracking domains for shortened URLs or URLs with multiple redirects aim to reduce spam, fraud, and abuse in the messaging industryHowever, link tracking is one of the few ways for companies to measure engagement or the success of SMS/MMS programsThis creates a frustrating situation for companies, especially when they are sending important messages that contain necessary links3 ways to improve delivery of messages with links To enhance the deliverability of messages containing URLs and avoid accidental blocks, here are a few steps you can take: 1Limit the number of redirects in your linksWhen a link takes users through multiple jumps to reach a different landing page or domain address, it raises suspicion for both users and carriersOptimize your link destination and consider using tracking methods like UTM parameters to avoid multiple redirects2Using a full-length URL is the carrier's first suggestion, but it can take up valuable space in an SMS where you also need to include your business identification and contextual information within the 160-character limitIf you have critical links, it might be best to use full-length URLs and accept the extra cost for additional message segments3When space is limited, consider using a branded shortened URL that is identifiable with your domainThis method is not limited to big brands like ESPN, Nike, or the New York TimesWhile it may seem cost-effective to use free public link shorteners like bit.ly or rb.gy, if your messages are not being delivered, the cost to your business can add upInvesting in a custom domain for shortened URLs is often more affordable than expectedRemember, you pay for the messages you send, not just the ones that are deliveredTherefore, maximizing your delivery rate is in the best interest of your business overall"

"Action Required: UK SMS Messages Sent Via International Long Codes Will Be Blocked from June 1, 2023","If you've recently sent text messages to United Kingdom (UK) mobile numbers using international long codes. Here's what you need to know: Effective from June 1, 2023, UK network operators will block SMS messages sent with international long codes.

Before June 1, 2023, use a local UK number to send A2P messages to the UK: If you are on LC Phone and not sure how to buy an SMS-capable number, please reach out to support so we can buy a mobile UK number for you. If you are not on LC Phone, follow these steps in the Twilio Console: Develop > Phone numbers > Buy a number > Country set to UK > Un-check Voice capabilities This will return a list of numbers you can buy for receiving messages What if you don't take action? Failure to take action will result in the blockage of SMS messages sent to the UK using international long codes starting from June 1, 2023."

large that it dominates the screen or causes scrollingThe mobile viewing experience differs considerably from the desktop due to the smaller screen size, so finding a balance is keyText Alignment: Alignment in mobile view can influence how easily your content is digestedCenter alignment is often used for mobile as it provides balance and fits well with the vertical nature of mobile screensLine Height: In the mobile view, adequate line spacing is even more critical for readability due to the smaller screenThe 1.5 setting provides a comfortable reading experienceHeading H2: Font Size: This setting defines the size of your secondary headers on a mobile screenSmaller than H1, but still prominent enough to distinguish the information hierarchyText Alignment: As with H1, center alignment often works well for mobile viewing, but the optimal alignment can depend on your specific content and designLine Height: The same principles apply here as with H1Line height is critical in how easily readers can move from one line to the next, particularly on smaller mobile screensHeading H3: Font Size: Your tertiary headers should be distinct but not overpoweringA smaller font size differentiates H3 from H1 and H2 headers but should still be readable on mobile screensText Alignment: The alignment for H3 may vary based on your specific design needs and contentKeeping it consistent with H1 and H2 usually aids in visual coherenceLine Height: Appropriate line height can ensure your content is accessible and easy to read, even on small screensParagraph: Font Size: Paragraph text should be comfortable to read on a mobile screen, which often means slightly larger font sizes than you might use on a desktopText Alignment: Paragraphs in mobile view are typically justified to the left for languages that read left-to-right, but this can depend on your specific content and design needsLine Height: Maintaining comfortable line spacing in paragraph text is especially crucial for long-form contentIt makes the text less dense and easier to follow on small screensButton: Font Size: The text on buttons should be easy to read and click on a mobile deviceLarger font size can help prevent misclicks and make calls-to-action more clearRemember, these are all starting points - depending on your content, audience, and overall design, you might need to adjust these settings to achieve the optimal mobile viewing experienceEmail Mobile View Configuration best practices: When configuring mobile emails, you need to pay close attention to a few key areas that contribute to the overall usability and effectiveness of your emails: Use a Single-Column Layout: Single-column layouts work best for mobile as they are easier to scale down for smaller screensMultiple columns can get cluttered on a mobile screen and may be confusing for users to navigateOptimize Images: Ensure your images are of high quality but also keep the file size small for quick loadingConsider using responsive images that will automatically adjust to fit the screen they're viewed onDon't forget to include alt text for accessibilityTouch-Friendly Buttons: On mobile devices, your CTAs will most likely be tapped with a finger rather than clicked with a mouseEnsure your buttons are large enough to be easily tapped - a minimum size of 44px by 44px is recommendedLimit Text Amount: On mobile devices, lengthy text can be dauntingBe concise and break your text into small, manageable chunksMake use of bullet points and subheadings for easy readabilityUse a Responsive Email Design: This will ensure that your email will automatically adjust to fit the screen of any device it's viewed onPreview and Test: Always preview and test your emails on different devices and email clients to ensure they display correctlyInclude White Space: White space isn't wasted spaceIt makes your email cleaner and easier to read on a small screenFont Size and Style: Keep your font size large enough to be readable on small screensA size of 14 for text and 22 for headlines is often recommendedAvoid fancy fonts that might be difficult to readClear and Concise CTAs: Make sure your call-to-action is clear, concise, and easy to findThe best place for a CTA button is generally in the middle of the screenOptimize Subject Lines and Preheader Text: Keep your subject lines short and engaging, and utilize the preheader text to provide a summary or teaser of your email contentIt's also a good idea to A/B test different versions of subject lines to find what works best for your audienceOpt for Plain Text Over Images: Some email clients may not automatically display imagesTo ensure your message gets across, use text as much as possible and only use images when necessaryUnsubscribe Option: Make it easy for recipients to opt out of your emailsNot only is this a legal requirement, but it also improves user experienceAccessibility: Make your email accessible to everyoneThis includes using larger fonts, ensuring good contrast between text and background, and including alt text for imagesRemember, the best practices for mobile email configuration may vary depending on your specific audience and the type of content you're sendingAlways test different approaches to see what works best for your audienceHere are some resources that could help further consolidate the mobile email design best

contains the requested data, an acknowledgment of the action performed, and an appropriate status codeStatus Code: A status code is a three-digit number returned by the server to indicate the outcome of an HTTP requestCommon status codes include 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 401 (Unauthorized), and 422 (Unprocessable Entity)HTTP Status Codes Distribution Type: Distribution Type refers to how an app is distributed or made available to GoHighLevel usersIt can be either Agency or Sub AccountAgency distribution allows the app to be used by all locations within an agency account, while Sub Account distribution limits usage to specific sub-accounts or individual locationsLocation ID: Location ID is a unique identifier assigned to a specific location within a GoHighLevel accountIt is used to differentiate and manage access at the location levelCompany ID: Company ID is a unique identifier assigned to a GoHighLevel company or accountIt helps differentiate and manage access at the company levelHashed Company ID: Hashed Company ID is a deprecated identifier that used to be associated with a GoHighLevel company or accountIt is no longer in use and is being phased outLive Server: Live Server refers to the actual production environment where the app interacts with GoHighLevel's API and real user dataIt is the server where the app is deployed and accessible by usersSDK (Software Development Kit): An SDK is a set of tools, libraries, and documentation developers use to build applications for a specific platform or frameworkGoHighLevel provides an SDK that facilitates the integration of custom apps with its APIAuthorization Header: The Authorization Header is an HTTP header that includes authentication credentials in API requests, such as an Access TokenIt typically takes the form ""Authorization: Bearer {access_token}""Understand the Authorization Header API Key: An API Key is a unique identifier or code provided to developers granting API accessIt serves as a form of authentication when making API requestsCallback URL: A Callback URL is where an app expects to receive callbacks or responsesIn the Developer's Marketplace context, the Callback URL is the endpoint that receives the authorization code or access token after the user grants permission during the OAuth processLearn more about Callback URLsJSON (JavaScript Object Notation): JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generateIt is commonly used for structuring data in API requests and responsesIntroduction to JSON Parameters: Parameters are additional values included in an API request to provide specific instructions or filter the desired dataParameters can be used to specify search criteria, sorting preferences, or pagination optionsUnderstanding API Parameters Pagination: Pagination is dividing a large data set into smaller, more manageable parts called pagesAPI responses often include pagination information, such as the number of items per page and the total number of pages, allowing developers to retrieve data incrementallyImplementing Pagination in APIs Rate Limiting: Rate Limiting is a mechanism APIs use to restrict client or user's requests within a specific periodIt helps maintain API performance and prevent abuseWebhooks: Webhooks are HTTP callbacks or notifications sent from one application to another when a specific event or trigger occursIn the Developer's Marketplace context, developers can configure webhooks to receive real-time updates or data from GoHighLevel, such as new leads or contact informationEvent: An Event refers to a specific occurrence or action within an application or systemIn the context of webhooks, events are triggers that prompt sending a webhook notificationRequest: A Request is an HTTP message sent from a client (such as an application) to a server (such as an API) to initiate an action or retrieve dataIt includes information such as the requested URL, method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, and optional bodyHTTP Request Methods Response: A Response is the HTTP message a server returns to a client in reply to its requestIt contains the requested data or indicates the status and outcome of the requestHTTP Response Status Codes GET: GET is an HTTP method to retrieve server dataIt is commonly used for fetching resources or information from APIsGET method in HTTP POST: POST is an HTTP method to submit data to a serverIt is typically used for creating new resources or sending data to be processed by APIsPOST method in HTTP PUT: PUT is an HTTP method to update or replace existing data on a serverIt replaces the entire resource with the new data provided in the requestPUT method in HTTP DELETE: DELETE is an HTTP method that removes or deletes a resource from a serverIt instructs the server to delete the specified resourceDELETE method in HTTP Front-End Development: Front-End Development involves building the user-facing components of a software applicationIt typically includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript developers to create interactive and visually appealing interfacesBack-End Development: Back-End Development focuses on the server-side components of a software applicationIt involves implementing the logic, data storage, and processing necessary to support the application's functionalityWhat is the OAuth Flow in the Developer's Marketplace? The GitHub Repository mentioned in the video is accessible herePostman tool Gohighlevel Developers Marketplace Gohighlevel Developers Community The OAuth Flow in the Developer's Marketplace typically consists of the following steps: App Registration: Developers register their applications on the Developer's Marketplace, providing necessary details and defining scopesThey receive a Client ID and a Client Secret, unique identifiers for their applicationAuthorization Request: The application directs the user (usually via a browser) to the Marketplace's authorization serverThe authorization request includes the Client ID, the requested scopes, and a redirect URL, a location in the application where users will be sent after authorizationUser Consent: The user logs into the Marketplace and reviews the application's request to access specific details (as defined by the scopes)If the user agrees, they are redirected to the provided redirect URL, with an authorization code appended as a query parameterAuthorization Grant: The application receives the authorization code and verifies itThe application then makes a POST request to the authorization server, including the authorization code, Client ID, and Client SecretAccess Token Issuance: If all the submitted details are correct and the authorization code is valid, the authorization server issues an access token to the applicationThe application can now use this access token to make requests to the API on behalf of the user, limited to the scopes defined earlierAPI Call: The application includes the access token in the header when making API callsThe server allows the requested operation if the access token is valid and has the necessary scopesToken Refresh: Access tokens have a limited lifetime and must be periodically refreshed using a refresh token (if provided by the authorization server)The application requests the server with the refresh token; a new access token is issued if it's validRemember, OAuth is a delegation protocol, handy in scenarios where the application must act on users' behalf without requiring users' credentialsThe actual flow might vary slightly based on the implementation of the Marketplace, but the basic principles remain the sameUsage Cases: Managing Contacts: Use the contact management APIs to create, update, search, and delete contacts, enabling efficient customer relationship managementConversations Management: Implement the Conversations API to retrieve, update, and delete conversations, allowing for streamlined customer communicationMessage Automation: Leverage the messaging APIs to send and schedule automated email and SMS messages, enhancing customer engagement and lead nurturingForm Submissions: Implement the forms APIs to capture and manage form submissions, enabling lead generation and data collectionLink Management: Use the links API to create, update, and delete links, allowing for effective tracking and management of URL linksLocation Tagging: Utilize the location tags APIs to assign and manage tags for different locations, facilitating organized categorization and filteringCustom Field Management: Implement the custom fields APIs to create, update, and delete custom fields, enabling flexible data organization and customizationCustom Value Management: Use the custom values APIs to create, update, and delete custom values associated with contacts, enhancing data personalizationTemplate Management: Leverage the email and SMS template APIs to create, retrieve, and update templates, facilitating consistent and efficient messagingOpportunity Management: Utilize the opportunities APIs to create, update, and delete opportunities, enabling effective sales pipeline managementNote Creation: Implement the create note API to add notes to customer profiles, facilitating easy documentation and information sharingTask Management: Use the task APIs to create, update, and delete tasks, enabling efficient task tracking and workflow managementAppointment Scheduling: Leverage the appointment APIs to create and update appointments, facilitating easy scheduling and calendar managementOrder Processing: Utilize the order APIs to create, update, and manage customer orders, streamlining the order fulfillment processCustomer Management: Implement the customer APIs to create, update, and delete customer profiles, facilitating comprehensive customer relationship managementUser Management: Use the user APIs to create, update, and delete user accounts, facilitating user administration and access controlWorkflow Automation: Leverage the workflow APIs to create, update, and delete workflows, enabling automated business processes and task automationSnapshot Retrieval: Utilize the snapshot APIs to retrieve and manage snapshots of data, allowing for historical data analysis and reportingThese usage cases demonstrate how the developer marketplace's APIs can be applied in various practical scenarios to enhance productivity, automate processes, and optimize business operationsHow to use the oAuth V2 to configure Webhooks for your apps?

If you already have some clients individually registered via Twilio for A2P 10 DLC, you may not necessarily need to re-register them through the LeadConnector (LC) phone systemThe registrations done through Twilio should still be valid and compliantHowever, it's important to note that using the LC phone system can leverage its additional capabilities and features designed to enhance your messaging workflows and provide a more streamlined experienceThese features may include improved campaign management, advanced reporting, integrated compliance checks, and moreWhile the individual client registrations through Twilio are sufficient for A2P 10 DLC compliance, transitioning to the LC phone system can offer you a more comprehensive solution within the HighLevel platformThe benefits and efficiencies of using the LC phone system for your messaging campaigns are worth consideringSuppose you migrate your clients from Twilio to the LC phone systemIn that case, following the steps and guidelines provided by the HighLevel team is recommended to ensure a smooth transition and avoid any disruption to your clients' messaging servicesYou may also want to inform your clients about the transition and the additional capabilities they can benefit from using the LC phone systemFor a sole prop, would you put the person's or DBA's name under the Business Details? For a sole proprietorship, when filling out the Business Details section, you would typically enter the legal name of the business ownerThis means you would provide the person's name rather than a Doing Business As (DBA) nameThe legal name refers to the sole proprietor's name as it appears on official documents such as government identification or tax recordsIt is essential to accurately enter the legal name to ensure compliance with registration requirements and to align with any existing legal documentation associated with the businessSuppose you are unsure about which name to enterIn that case, consulting with a legal professional or tax advisor who can provide guidance based on your jurisdiction's specific requirements and regulations is recommendedThey can help ensure the business details align with legal and regulatory standardsDoes each subaccount have to go through the registration process? Regardless of geographic location, each subaccount within your agency must go through the registration process to comply with the A2P 10DLC guidelinesThe registration requirements apply to all businesses and agencies that use A2P messaging services within the United StatesRegardless of whether your subaccounts are located in the United States or other countries, if they use US-based phone numbers to send A2P messages, they must follow the registration process outlined by the A2P 10DLC programThe program is designed to regulate and authenticate A2P messaging activities in the United StatesIt's important to note that compliance requirements vary by country, so if you have subaccounts outside the United States and are using non-US phone numbers for A2P messaging, you should check the local regulations and guidelines to ensure compliance in those respective countriesIn summary, while the registration process primarily applies to US-based phone numbers, it is still necessary for all subaccounts within your agency, regardless of their geographic location, to go through the registration process if they are using US-based phone numbers for A2P messaging within the United StatesPlease explain excessive marketing messagesWhen referring to ""excessive marketing messages"" in the context of a sole proprietorship, you should avoid sending an excessive volume of promotional or marketing text messages to recipientsWhile the exact threshold for what constitutes ""excessive"" may vary depending on the specific regulations and guidelines of your jurisdiction, here are some general considerations: Compliance with Anti-Spam Laws: Ensure your marketing messages comply with anti-spam laws, such as the CAN-SPAM Act in the United States or CASL in CanadaThese laws typically require obtaining prior consent from recipients and providing precise opt-out mechanismsFrequency and Timing: Avoid sending overwhelming marketing messages to recipients within a short periodSending messages too frequently can lead to recipient fatigue or annoyance, potentially leading to complaints or opt-outsRelevance and Targeting: Tailor your marketing messages to be relevant to the recipient's interests and preferencesSending irrelevant or unsolicited messages can be perceived as spam and may result in negative feedback or non-complianceOpt-In and Opt-Out Processes: Implement transparent opt-in processes to ensure that recipients explicitly consent to receive marketing messages from your sole proprietorshipAdditionally, provide easy-to-use opt-out mechanisms to honor recipients' requests to unsubscribe from further communicationsContent Quality: Maintain a high standard of content quality in your marketing messagesAvoid misleading or deceptive practices, and ensure that your statements provide genuine value to recipientsWhat's the time frame for approval?

SMS is coming from a different Twilio number than the one in Phone Numbers tab,"Issue: There's confusion regarding sending text messages in Mexico, as the recipient sees a different number than the one you sent it from. This happens due to a specific regulation in Mexico for mobile text messages. In Mexico, AT&T is the only mobile company that allows texts to be sent from a regular phone number. These messages are primarily intended for person-to-person, or P2P, conversations. According to the rules, if more than nine texts are sent from the same number in less than two minutes, the system automatically changes the 'Sender ID' - the number from which the message appears to be sent. This is done to comply with Mexico's regulations. Therefore, if your messages are appearing from a different number, it's due to this regulation being applied. To avoid this, please vote here so we can support shortcode."

frequently asked questions about controlInfrastructure Security Cloud Hosting Provider HighLevel does not host any product systems or data within its physical ofﬁcesHighLevel outsources hosting of its product infrastructure to leading cloud infrastructure providers such as Google Cloud Platform Services and Amazon Web ServicesOur product infrastructure resides in the United StatesWe place reliance on Google’s and AWS’s audited security and compliance programs for the efﬁcacy of their physical, environmental, and infrastructure security controlsGoogle provides a monthly uptime percentage to customers of at least 99.5%You can ﬁnd more information about the controls, processes, and compliance measures implemented by Google on their publicly available Compliance Resource CenterAWS

independently validated as part of their SOC 2 Type 2 report and ISO 27001 certiﬁcationAWS’s compliance documentation and audit reports are publicly available at the AWS Cloud Compliance Page and the AWS Artifacts PortalNetwork and Perimeter The HighLevel product infrastructure enforces multiple layers of ﬁltering and inspection on all connections across our web application, logical ﬁrewalls, and security groupsNetwork-level access control lists are implemented to prevent unauthorized access to our internal product infrastructure and resourcesBy default, ﬁrewalls are conﬁgured to deny network connections that are not explicitly authorizedChanges to our network and perimeter systems are controlled by standard change control processesFirewall rulesets are reviewed periodically to help ensure that only necessary connections are conﬁguredConﬁguration Management Automation drives HighLevel’s ability to scale with our customers’ needs and rigorous conﬁguration management is baked into our day-to-day infrastructure processingThe product infrastructure is a highly automated environment that expands capacity as neededAll server conﬁgurations are embedded in images and conﬁguration ﬁles, which are used when new containers are provisionedEach container includes its own hardened conﬁguration and changes to the conﬁguration and standard images are managed through a controlled change pipelineServer instances are tightly controlled from provisioning through deprovisioning, ensuring that deviations from conﬁguration baselines are detected and reverted at a predeﬁned cadenceIn the event that a production server deviates or drifts from the baseline conﬁguration, it will be overwritten with the baseline within 30 minutesPatch management is handled using automated conﬁguration management tools or by removing server instances that are no longer compliant with the expected baselineLogging Actions and events that occur within the HighLevel application are consistently and comprehensively loggedThese logs are indexed and stored in a central logging solution hosted in HighLevel’s cloud environmentSecurity relevant logs are also retained, indexed, and stored to facilitate investigation and response activitiesThe retention period of logs depends on the nature of the data loggedWrite access to the storage service in which logs are stored is tightly controlled and limited to a small subset of engineers who require accessAlerting and Monitoring HighLevel invests in automated monitoring, alerting, and response capabilities to continuously address potential issuesThe HighLevel product infrastructure is instrumented to alert engineers and administrators when anomalies occurIn particular, error rates, abuse scenarios, application attacks, and other anomalies trigger automatic responses or alerts to the appropriate teams for response, investigation, and correctionMany automated triggers are also designed to immediately respond to anomalous situationsFor example, trafﬁc throttling, process termination, and similar functions are triggered at predeﬁned thresholdsApplication Security Web Application Defenses All customer content hosted on the platform is protected by ﬁrewall and application securityThe monitoring tools actively monitor the application layer and can alert on malicious behavior based on behavior type and session rateThe rules used to detect and block malicious trafﬁc are aligned to the best practice guidelines documented by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), speciﬁcally the OWASP Top 10 and similar recommendationsProtections from Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are also incorporated, helping to ensure customers’ web sites and other parts of the HighLevel products are continuously

Pre and Post buffers,"TABLE OF CONTENTS What are buffers? How to set buffers How to turn off buffers Buffer Logic Buffer Duration Affecting Available Slots FAQs What are buffers? Buffers are additional time that can be added before and/or after a GHL eventThis feature can be beneficial if you need extra time to get ready before a meeting, travel to an event, or wrap up after a presentationBuffer settings are customised for each event type, allowing you to fine-tune and optimize them as needed How to set buffers Here's how to add buffers to your appointments: Choose the calendar to which you want to add buffers for appointmentsIf you're creating a new calendar, go to ""Advanced Settings."" If you're working with an existing calendar, click on ""Edit."" Navigate to the ""Availability"" sectionLook for the options labeled ""Pre buffer time"" and ""Post buffer time"" Specify the duration you want for both the pre and post buffersDon't forget to save your settingsThese buffers will ensure you have the extra time you need before and after your appointmentsHow to turn off buffers Choose the calendar for which you would want to turn off the buffers and click on edit Go to ""Availability"" and scroll down to the page where you see ""Pre and Post buffer"" Make the values as ""0"" Don't forget to save your settings This will ensure that going forward any appointment which gets booked on that calendar would not have any buffers Buffer Logic Buffers are only applied to appointments created within the system or through third-party calendars with the 'Allow Contact Creation' feature enabledHowever, blocked slots or events synced from third-party calendars (Google, Outlook, iCloud) are considered when applying buffersThis ensures that buffers do not overlap with blocked slots, providing appropriate buffer times for appointmentsBuffer Duration Affecting Available Slots Using the example above, if there's a 30-minute event with 15-minute buffers before and after, someone else booking on the same day will see an available slot 30 minutes after the existing bookingIt's important to note that when using both Pre and Post buffers, there are instances where seemingly large free periods in the calendar cannot be bookedThis is due to double buffering, where both before and after buffers are applied, resulting in the removal of significant time slots from the scheduling pageTo maximize bookable time slots on your scheduling page, consider your event types to use only a single buffer, either pre or post buffer A new event cannot be scheduled if it does not match the buffer criteria for that appointment slot as well as the previous booked slotNote that if you set buffers for an individual schedule event, it will affect the user's availability across other calendars where they are involved as wellIn a round-robin calendar event, individual buffer settings on a user's other calendars can result in an uneven distribution of appointmentsIn a collective calendar event, an individual's buffer settings on their other calendars can block available slots that might otherwise appear free, as the buffer time occupies those slotsFAQs Question: Do buffers impact events booked outside of GHL? Answer: Buffers are applicable solely to appointments booked through the GHL appHowever, there is an exception: if your two-way sync or smart sync feature is enabled (where the system converts third-party calendar events into appointments instead of treating them as blocked slots), buffers would be applied in such a scenarioQuestion: How do buffers affect available time slots for scheduling appointments? Answer: Buffers affect available time slotsFor example, if a 30-minute event has 15-minute pre and post buffers, the next appointment will be scheduled 30 minutes after the existing bookingDouble buffers can limit seemingly free periods in the calendar, removing significant time slotsTo maximize bookable time slots, consider using a single buffer (either pre or post)Question: Can I remove or alter a buffer once it's set for a booked appointment? Answer: Once a buffer is set for a booked appointment, it can be removed or alteredBuffers are applied based on the latest settingsQuestion: What happens if buffer settings are different on an individual's other calendars in a round-robin calendar event? Answer: In a round-robin calendar event, varying buffer settings on an individual's other calendars can result in an uneven distribution of appointments among usersQuestion: Can buffer settings on an individual's other calendars affect the booking of appointments in a collective calendar event? Answer: Yes, in a collective calendar event, buffer settings on an individual's other calendars can block available slots that may otherwise appear free due to buffer time occupying those slotsQuestion: What is double buffer? Answer: Double buffering refers to the use of both pre-buffer and post-buffer times before and after an event or appointmentIt means that extra time is added both before and after an event, effectively extending the duration of the bufferThis can result in time slots that appear to be free on the calendar but are not available for booking because the double buffering occupies those time slotsDouble buffering reduces the number of bookable appointments within a given timeframe"

You Sending Domain, is how the internet routes emailsIt Rather than sharing the domain provided for all users, a dedicated email domain is a single private domain you use to send and receive emailsWithin HighLevel, when you are using LC Email - you have the ability to create your own dedicated domainIf you are using a non-LC Email (or SMTP Provider) you will not have this ability in-appWhy it matters? Not having a Dedicated Email Sending Domain often results in your emails going into SPAM despite practices good emailingWhen you set up a Dedicated Email Sending Domain, you can gain full control of your reputation and email deliverabilityThis means you can work your way into all emails going into the inbox while avoiding that SPAM folderHow to Set it Up? If you haven't already, it is highly recommended to have your own Dedicated Domain for sending emailsTo set up your Dedicated Email Sending Domain, check out this step-by-step guideWhat if I already have a Dedicated Email Sending Domain and my Emails are going to SPAM? If this describes you, please click here to learn more2Set Up a Dedicated Sending IP Address What is it? Dedicated IPs offer a distinct advantage by sending your email messages from a unique, exclusive IP addressEmail service providers (ESPs) closely monitor the reputation and behavior of an IP address to determine the deliverability of emails linked to specific domains associated with that IPGetting a dedicated IP address provides your organization with exclusive ownership, giving you full control over the management of the email sender's reputation and deliverability tied to that IPLearn more here: What is a Dedicated Sending IP Address? Why it Matters? If you have an LC Email Dedicated Sending Domain (see point 1 above), you share the same Sending IP Address with all of HighLevelMailbox providers give a reputation to IP addresses, so this could negatively impact your sending, especially at high volumeA dedicated sending IP address helps you control more of your email-sending health to build your own IP reputationThis becomes more important when sending high-volume, especially 200k emails or moreHow to Set it Up? While everyone can benefit from a Dedicated Sending IP, businesses sending more than 200,000 emails a week will benefit the most from this serviceTo set up and learn more about Dedicated Sending IP Address, check out this guideWhat are the Costs? $59 per month per IPThe amount is billed to the Agency Billing Card on fileThe agency can set up rebilling to cover this cost by rebilling the client this amountLearn more about the pricing hereAdditional Resources: Reserve DNS (rDNS) Set Up, Fixing ""Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner"" 3Enable Email Validation What is it? Email Validation will check if the email you are sending is valid or notSending to an invalid email can negatively impact your email deliverabilityWhy it matters? If you send emails that do not exist or are not valid, it harms your domain reputation leading to poor email deliverabilityMeaning emails will go to spam or not be accepted into the mailbox at allHow to enable it? We’ve actually made it as easy as possible to validate your emails, it is a setting in your Sub-Accounts SettingsEnabling Email Verification for the Sub-Account Sub-Account View > Business Profile > Scroll to the “Verify Email Address when the first email is sent to a new contact” > check boxEmail Validation every 90 days Agency View > Sub-accounts > Click on the sub-account name > Scroll down to “Enable Re-validation for 90 days”Learn more here: How to enable and rebill LC Email ValidationWhat are the Costs?

An email bounce occurs when an email is not delivered or rejected by the recipient's email providerThere are two types of bouncesA hard bounce occurs when an email address does not existA soft bounce is a temporary failure, and some more reasons, like the recipient servers being down or the mailbox being fullWhy it matters? Too many bounced emails will harm your domain reputation leading to emails going to SPAMThis is why marking hard-bounced emails as invalid is important to enableHow to enable it? You can choose to mark emails as invalid if they bounce from within the Sub-Account SettingsEnabling Email Verification for the Sub-Account Sub-Account View > Business Profile > Scroll to the “Mark Emails as invalid due to Hard Bounce” > check boxLearn more here: What is email Bounce Suspension, and how to avoid it 5Add Your DMARC Record What is it? A DMARC Record provides instructions to receiving servers about how to handle incoming mailIn order to get delivered, messages need to pass DKIM and SPF alignment checks according to the requirements set by the DMARC policyMessages that do not pass DMARC checks can be rejected, reported back to the domain owner, or placed in the spam folderWhy Add it? Not having a DMARC Record can negatively impact your domain reputation and email deliverabilityOften, mailbox providers count it against you when DMARC Records are not set up properly - resulting in emails going to SPAMHow to Add it? To add a DMARC record, you must log into your DNS provider and add the following TXT record belowAdd a TXT Record in your DNS Setting for your DMARC policy without the """" Type: “TXT” Name: “_dmarc” Content: “v=DMARC1; p=reject"" To confirm your DMARC Record is applied correctly, you can use this DMARC CheckerAdditional Resources for DMARC: Email Authentication - DMARC Add your DMARC Record DMARC Reports 6Use the Proper “From Email” What is it? The “From Email” is the email a recipient will see when receiving an emailFor example, your Sending Domain might be “mail.gohighlevel.com” however, you can send your From Email as “test@gohighlevel.com.” or as “test@mail.gohighlevel.com.” Why it matters? Using a “from email” that does not match the primary domain you are sending from can result in poor email deliverabilityHow to Set It Up? Whenever you are sending from HighLevel, be sure your “From Email” has your primary domain in the “From Email.” So if you set up replies.yourcompany.com, you can send from sender_name@company.comFor example, if I have a sending domain of “mail.gohighlevel.com” – My From Email needs to have “gohighlevel.com” in the email address, such as “highly-test@gohighlevel.com”Any other record will result in poor email deliverabilitySee more information here: Masking Sender Emails - From Name & Address 7Add Unsubscribe Links What is it? An unsubscribe link allows your users to “unsubscribe” from receiving emails from you in the futureWhy it Matters? Not having an unsubscribe link will severely harm your email deliverability ratesHow to Set It Up? We make it as easy as possible to add an unsubscribe link all of your emailsWithin the email builder, our “Footer” ElementBe sure to use this or edit and create your ownYou have two options, you can use the default unsubscribe link we’ve automatically set up for you or you can create your own!

A Double Opt-In is when you ask subscribers to opt-in twiceFor example, they fill out a form and then “verify” their email address by clicking a link to “Verify” their emailOnly after someone has double opted-in will you start sending them emailsThis is in contrast to a single opt-in which will start sending emails to recipients right after the first opt-inWhy it Matters? Double opt-ins are highly beneficial to your domain reputation and email deliverabilityThis is because users have double opt-in to receive emails from youThink about it… the act of a recipient receiving their first email from you, then opening, and clicking on a link within this email looks really good for your domainIn addition, it ensures your list knows and wants to receive emails from youWhich is invaluable when list buildingHow to Set It Up? To set up a Double Opt-In Email Flow, we must do some quick building in HighLevelSee the how to build a Double Opt-In Flow here: How To Build A Double Opt-In Flow9Stop Sending to Unengaged Emails What is it? As simple as it sounds… When sending to your email list, do not send to unengaged emailsMeaning if they do not take the action to open or perform the next step in your campaign stop sending to themWhy does it matter? When you send to a more engaged group of people, your emails go into the inbox more oftenWhereas fewer open or links clicked (engagement) will result in emails going to spamHow do I do this? If you have been sending to the same person who has taken no action for weeks, send to them less frequently or not at allWhile it hurts to trim the list, it’ll hurt more to ruin your email deliverability due to unengaged recipientsIt just isn’t worth it and there are no hard feelings for users not wanting to engage with youFocus your efforts on those that ARE engaging with youIt is better to stop sending to an unengaged recipient than it is to have them ""unsubscribe"" or ""mark as SPAM."" 10Send Regularly… Just Not Too Regularly What is it? Another large factor in your sending domain's reputation is how often you send emailsIf you only send out an email blast to your list once a month or once every couple of weeks - it can negatively impact your reputationIn contrast, if you send it every day or multiple times a day, it is just as badEspecially if in the past you didn’t send it like thisWhy does it matter? Thus, it is important to consider how often you sendWhen someone has opted in and is engaging (opening emails, clicking on links in those emails), then you can send a bit moreBut after they are not engaged, slow it down to weeklyAnd as covered above, if users are unengaged, stop sending them all togetherHow often you send and how engaged your recipients are can play a huge role in ensuring emails arrive in the inboxHow do I do this? There are many opinions out there on how often to send and when to sendIn general, we've found success in only sending to opt-in (preferably double opt-in) recipientsAfter they have signed up we send them about an email a day for the first 5 days, then we slow down to a couple a weekThis is until they take the action we wantIf they take no action after 20 days, we only send weekly emails until we have another planned promotionOur Recommendations: If someone has opted in (preferably a Double Opt-In) you can send to them daily for a brief time to convert them… If after a week or two of no engagement, slow the sending down to them to a weekly cadenceIf they are not engaged for a longer time, say two months of weekly emails, stop sending them all togetherYou can send out special promotions or offers as you have them Just consider how often this is and keep them shorterIt's important to send fewer than to oversendIn addition, it's important to stop sending to unengaged recipients, remember the above..It is better to stop sending to an unengaged recipient than it is to have them ""unsubscribe"" or ""mark as SPAM.""

We will first need to “Warm Up” your email domainAs this is a NEW Dedicated Sending Domain, it does not have any reputation - good or badHowever, mailbox providers will often SPAM emails from new domainsThis makes sense because anyone can make a new sending domain (like a spammer for example) and get sendingWhat is Email Deliverability? In short, “Email Deliverability” refers to how well your emails are placed in the inbox (not the spam or promotions or another place)For simplicity, you can think of email deliverability as your ability to send an email and have it arrive in the Inbox and not SPAMEmail deliverability is super complex, consisting of dozens of unique factorsThe most common ones are Sender Reputation, Subscriber Engagement, List Health, Consistency, and even your email content… When a mailbox receives an email, it considers all of these factors when choosing where to place the inbound emailLearn more about Email Deliverability here: An Introduction To Email Deliverability & What is Email Deliverability? - A Guest-Tutorial From Krystin Ruschman of Email-2-InboxWhat is Domain Reputation? Domain reputation is the rating or score given to your domainThe internet and mailbox providers rate your domain, giving it a reputation or trust score that helps determine if they should accept emails from your sending domain into the mailbox as well as if to place it in spam or promotionsDomain Reputation, just like Email Deliverability, is complexWhat is important is that both will determine how successful you are at landing outgoing emails into an Inbox and NOT into the SPAM folderPoor Domain Reputation = Poor Email Deliverability That’s why we’ve outlined your Email Best Practices, Warm Up Sending Recommendations, and some FAQs below to help make this complex process - as clear as possibleHow Long Until a Domain is Warmed Up? It can take up to four weeks for your domain to be fully warmed up with no emails coming into spamEnsure you confirm you are practicing all of the Email Best Practices above and check out our “Email Tools” section above for ways to troubleshoot, monitor, and improve your email deliverabilityWhat happens if I want to send more than the recommended amount? If you skip or do not follow the Email Best Practices or Bulk Email Sending RecommendationsYour email deliverability and domain reputation will likely decrease, resulting in emails going to SPAMIn later stages, you will be blacklisted and emails will not even be accepted by mailbox providersWhat are the Differences Between LC Email and a Custom SMTP Provider? It is important to note the difference between LC Email and Custom SMTP ProviderLC Email is short for LeadConnector Email, which is the email service HighLevel has created for youWhile using LC Email, you can create your own custom domain on LC email, giving you great control over email deliverabilityThis is in contrast to Custom SMTP Provider Users, who have decided to use their own custom email settings and not HighLevel'sThis option limits how much HighLevel can assist in email deliverability as the advanced settings are now managed fully by the user's custom email settingsWhile our team will try to assist as best we can, many of the advanced settings listed below will not be available to you as you will need to consult your Cusotm SMTP Provider and set up these settings yourselfIt is recommended to use our LC Email Service as we have taken a number of proactive steps toward sending emails in HighLevel easier and more effectivelyYou will notice features and settings that are only available on LC EmailWhat is a Dedicated Domain? When you sign up for LC Email, you gain access to our generic domain to send emails from todayHowever, this is shared by all of our users and is not the best in email deliverabilityWhen you think about it, this makes sense, as all of our users share this domainWith a dedicated domain, you can have greater control over your email deliverabilityHow to Send Emails in Drip Mode? (Hourly and Daily Sending) When sending your emails, it is always wise to use “drop mode” to send your emails out over a period of time, rather than all at onceTo do so, you can follow the instructions in this article to learn how to perform a “Bulk Action” in HighLevelIn short, a Bulk action will give you the option to perform a task (like sending an email) over a period of timeThis works for Workflows as wellSee Bulk Actions for Contacts & SmartlistsWhat is an Email Bounce?

RSS feeds are still very much alive, though they may be a bit trickier to locate these daysUnlike in the past, browsers no longer highlight them, and websites don't always prominently display RSS linksHowever, the majority of sites do offer RSS feedsLet's explore some quick ways to find them when a simple Google search isn't enoughFor instance, a substantial number of websites are built using WordPress, accounting for over 40% of the webThis means there's a high likelihood that the website you're visiting is a WordPress site, and they typically offer easily discoverable RSS feedsTo find a WordPress RSS feed, just add ""/feed"" to the end of the URLFor instance, https://justinpot.com/feedThis method works in most cases and is my go-to approach for finding RSS feedsIf this doesn't yield results, here are a few additional tricks to try on other types of sites: For sites hosted on Tumblr, append ""/rss"" to the URLFor example: https://example.tumblr.com/rssOn Blogger-hosted sites, tack on ""feeds/posts/default"" to the end of the URLFor example: example.blogspot.com/feeds/posts/defaultIf a publication is on Medium, insert ""/feed/"" before the publication's nameSo, medium.com/example-site becomes medium.com/feed/example-siteYouTube channel pages can serve as RSS feedsJust copy and paste the channel's URL into your RSS readerYou can also find an OPML file containing all your subscriptions thereIf none of these methods prove successful, you can resort to checking a webpage's source codeDon't worry, it's simpler than it soundsRight-click on an empty space on the website where you'd like to find an RSS feed, then select ""View Page Source"" (the phrasing might vary slightly depending on your browser)Next, search the code by pressing Ctrl+F (Windows, Linux) or Command+F (Mac)Start with a search for ""rss,"" like so: If ""rss"" doesn't yield results, try ""atom"" insteadLook for an RSS URL, as shown above, then copy and paste it into your feed readerHappy feed hunting! How to Create Posts using RSS Feed? Navigate to Marketing > Social Planner Click on ""New Post"", there will be option to select the ""RSS Post"" Add the URL of RSS Feed [ Check above how to find the RSS url] Select the socials where you would like to postNote - It will not allow selection of Twitter due to API RestrictionsYou can add ""End with"" option to append any text, hashtags or linksSelect the option to update the feed update - from after every 5 mins to once in a day Select the option of number of post ( minimum 1 to maximum 5)"

Reverse DNS white labeling - Dedicated IP,"When recipients open your email, it's generally more advantageous to display your company name instead of ""Sent by Mailgun"" or another third-party serviceBy configuring reverse DNS (rDNS), mailbox providers can be directed to present your company name in the ""From"" or ""Sender"" fieldThis approach not only elevates the professionalism of your email communications but also strengthens your brand identityFurthermore, featuring your company name in the ""From"" field rather than a third-party service yields enhanced deliverability and tracking benefitsIt fosters trust with recipients, diminishes the chance of your emails being flagged as spam, and assures consistent branding across your email campaignsIn summary, applying your company name via reverse DNS settings presents a more positive, brand-centric method for email communications, enhancing both deliverability and trackingTABLE OF CONTENTS What is reverse DNS (rDNS)? Common rDNS mistakes How to set up rDNS? What is reverse DNS (rDNS)? Reverse DNS (rDNS) is essentially the reverse of a standard DNS queryInstead of mapping a domain name to an IP address, rDNS translates an IP address to its associated hostnameThis process is applicable to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and verifies the authenticity of the sending email serverIn practical applications, rDNS converts the IP address of the sending email server into its corresponding hostname (e.g., example.com)This verification affirms that the IP address relates to a legitimate domainIn email marketing, this allows you to use services like Mailgun to display your company as the sender, rather than ""Sent by Mailgun.com""To clarify, this is distinct from masking the CNAME of mailgun.org in your DNS settingsHere, we're focusing on rDNS configuration for your dedicated IP used for emailingProper rDNS setup improves your email deliverability and branding by ensuring your company name is showcased as the sender in recipients' inboxesCommon rDNS mistakes Setting rDNS records accurately is vital for email deliverability and upholding a reputable sender statusSome frequent rDNS pitfalls include: Incorrect PTR Record: One common mistake is not having a valid PTR (Pointer) record associated with your IP addressA PTR record is essential for verifying that the sending mail server matches the IP address claimed in the email messageEnsure that your PTR record is set up correctly and returns a hostname for the IP address being queriedMismatched Hostname: The hostname returned by the PTR record should resolve back to the same IP addressThis means that the IP address should point to the hostname, and the hostname should point back to the same IP addressIf there's a mismatch, it can lead to rDNS lookup failuresFor example, if your PTR record is set to return ""mail.yourwebsite.com"" for IP address 8.8.8.8, it's crucial that when you perform an rDNS lookup for ""mail.yourwebsite.com,"" it resolves to 8.8.8.8Hostname Resolution Failure: In some cases, the hostname specified in the PTR record may not resolve at allThis is a significant problem as it can lead to delivery issues and a lack of trust with email providersTo resolve this issue, ensure that the specified hostname resolves to the correct IP addressIn summary, rDNS is a critical component of email authentication and deliverabilityTo avoid common rDNS mistakes, make sure your PTR records are set up correctly and that the hostname returned by the PTR record accurately maps to the associated IP addressThis alignment helps establish trust with email providers and improves the chances of your emails reaching recipients' inboxesHow to set up rDNS? It's important to note that setting up reverse DNS (rDNS) with multiple hostnames can only be done when using a dedicated IPShared IPs do not support this functionality, as rDNS can resolve to only one hostname per IP addressUtilizing a dedicated IP for this purpose adds a professional touch to your email communications and can positively influence your reputation with inbox providersTo set up rDNS with multiple hostnames on your dedicated IP, follow the steps below: Input the “A record” into your zone file at your hosting providerAn “A record” will look something like this: A, mail.customer.com, 123.45.67.89 Navigate to agency settings -> email serviceIn SMTP service tab, Click on the Dedicated Domain And IP in LeadConnector sectionGo the dedicated IP section and click on the three dots in dedicated IP and click on Reverse DNS (PTR) Provide the same A record that you have added in the input, and we’ll update the PTR record on our end to match the hostname you’re using"

What happens behind the scenes? But I want to use my funnel to sell this instead of Checkout linksHow can I do that? How can I import my modified SaaS products and prices to the sub-account (location) I want to use for selling SaaS? What about the wallet recharges (credits)? Native support for selling SaaS sub-accounts in currencies other than the USD will be available soonUntil that time this workaround should work for all our SaaS agenciesCan I sell SaaS in non-USD currencies? Yes, you canBy following the workaround detailed in this document, our SaaS agencies can sell SaaS in almost any currency supported by StripeClick here to check which currencies Stripe supports based on your business countryBut when I create SaaS product they are always in USDHow can I change that? Initially, create your SaaS products in USD using the SaaS ConfiguratorThen login to your Stripe account and the products will look like this Now edit the prices and change the currency in your desired currencyIn this in example I will be using USDNow your Stripe products will be in the currency of your choice instead of USDIt should look like this Repeat this process for all your SaaS products and pricesMy SaaS Configurator still shows USDIs that a problem? No, it's notWhile the SaaS Configurator in your HighLevel agency view will continue to display products and prices in USD, the currency set in Stripe takes precedenceThe currency onside Stripe overrides the currency in the SaaS ConfiguratorHow can I start selling SaaS in this new currency? You can start by generating payment links for your SaaS productsThe checkout will then reflect your chosen currency instead of USDAs you can see the checkout would be in the currency of your choice instead of USDWhat happens behind the scenes? Upon checkout using your SaaS link, a customer profile is created in your Stripe account, along with an associated subscription, payment, and invoice (if no trial is offered) The invoice and receipt will also be in your currency instead of USDBut I want to use my funnel to sell this instead of Checkout linksHow can I do that? If you wish to use HighLevel funnels to sell your SaaS products instead of using the checkout link, then you can simply import these prices (the once we updated to your currency instead of USD) to that sub-account as shown belowMake sure the Stripe account connected to your sub-account (location) that you'd use to sell your SaaS products is the same as the Stripe account connected to your agencyYou can check the Stripe account connected to a sub-account (location) by visiting Location Level -> left menu -> payments -> integrations You can check the Stripe account connected to the agency by visiting Agency Level -> left menu -> Settings -> Stripe Once you have validated that both Strip accounts are the same you can start importing your SaaS products in that sub-account (location)How can I import my modified SaaS products and prices to the sub-account (location) I want to use for selling SaaS?

What about the wallet recharges (credits)? Yes, the sub-account credit charges (wallet recharges) will also be in the currency of your choiceHowever please keep in mind the usage will still be shown in USDThe charge to your customers (invoices & receipts) will be in your currencyHowever, in the usage records (inside HighLevel -> Location level -> left menu -> settings -> company billing) usage will still show up in USDFor example in this case, the user added US$ 100 to their creditsIt shows up like this in their usage records Behind the scenes, HighLevel automatically converts this amount (US$ 100) to your currency (AUD in this example) and runs the charge on Stripe in your currencyThats why you would see the associated receipt to be in the currency of your choicePlease look at this receipt for reference"

How to Use Webhooks in HighLevel (A) Inbound Webhook (B) Outbound Webhook FAQs What is Zapier, Make, or Pabbly? Getting Started with Zapier What are the Differences Between API and Webhooks? Introduction Needing some information from another application you use? Webhooks are certainly one of the first choices for many users, as they greatly increase your ability to send information from one place to anotherIf our powerful HighLevel Workflow Automations are not able to perform a task for you - chances are that a webhook can..Or at least get you close! In this article, we will walk through how to use webhooks in HighLevelWhat are Webhooks? HTTPS request (or webhooks) powers nearly everything you interact with on the internetWebhooks are what allow applications like HighLevel to talk to Stripe, Twilio, Mailgun, Zapier, and moreNow, you can have full access to webhooks to make your business needs come alive! Webhooks are a great way to connect applicationsWebhooks allow platforms to communicate to complete unique tasks by connecting applications togetherBelow we will review common terms when using WebhooksHelpful Definitions: HTTPS Request - The official term for the type of request a webhook is… An HTTP is the primary way to send information between websites and web browsersHTTPS is a more secure version, which encrypts the data when it is transferredTriggering Event - The unique event that occurs, signaling an app to send information to the Webhook URL of another appWebhook URL - A unique URL created by the app receiving a webhook requestIt’s kind of like an address or phone numberPayload - refers to all of the information packaged and sent from one app to anotherQuery Params - much like UTM Parameters, Query Params are a helpful way to map information using the Webhook URLWhich can be better used by the receiving application when mapping the payloadMapping - Like connecting the dots, mapping is the process of taking the payload received and “mapping” to the correct fields for use in the receiving applicationFor example, the payload has a contact name, email, and purchased service nameYou will need to “map” or connect this information from the payload, into the correct custom fields for the contact within the HighLevel WorkflowHow do Webhooks Work? Generally, webhooks are used to connect applicationsThey require a triggering event that signals one app to send the request to another appFor example, a purchase happens in your payment software Stripe, which will be sent to HighLevelSo Stripe will package the information up into a “payload” (or the information sent out) which is sent to HighLevelIn HighLevel, the information received can then be used to perform tasksTo use Webhooks, one application needs to provide the Webhook URLA Webhook URL is a unique URL created by the app receiving a webhook requestIt’s kind of like an address or phone numberWhen you want to call a business, you require their unique phone number and even an extension at times to get to the right departmentA Webhook URL is much the same - it is a unique phone number used to make a call request toUse Case Example You own a Shopify eCommerce store that utilizes Stripe to process your paymentsYou want to use HighLevel to send emails to specific users who have purchased a specific courseHowever, the information from the purchases is not in HighLevel - so you don't know who purchased whatTo send emails to the correct contacts in HighLevel, you will need to create a webhook event to fire into HighLevel every time that specific product is purchased in StripeHighLevel can then use this information to perform specific tasks, like sending emails to those specific contacts who purchased the productIn this scenario, you will use the HighLevel Workflow trigger ""inbound Webhook"" to catch the information from StripeTo make it easier, we recommend you use Zapier or another automation software, to trigger when the purchase is made in Stripe (if you are not using a HighLevel Order Form or Product)When the purchase is made, a payload is packaged up with all of the information you need in HighLevelHighLevel catches and receives the information that is used to perform your specific tasksIn this case, marketing to your buyers who bought that specific productThat's the overview of webhooks, but there is A LOT more to learnFor now, this will get you startedBelow, we will review the two ways you can use webhooks in HighLevelHow to Use Webhooks in HighLevel There are two ways to utilize Webhooks in HighLevelIn potentially over-simplistic terms, there are “Catching” and “Sending” WebhooksTwo ways to use Webhooks in HighLevel: (A) Inbound Webhook “Catching” an Inbound Webhook Request in a HighLevel Workflow TriggerAs the names suggest “Catching” is all about receiving or “catching” a webhook request made to the HighLevel Webhook URLIn HighLevel, this is a Workflow Trigger called an “Inbound Webhook.” (B) Outbound Webhook “Sending” an Outbound Webhook Request with a HighLevel Workflow ActionIn contrast to the above “Catching” motion… “Sending” is when you make a request to an external Webhook URLIn HighLevel, this is a Workflow Action called “Webhook.” Below, we will walk through each scenario and how to perform it in HighLevelOrder: Trigger, Action, Trigger, Action Another helpful way to learn about webhooks is to see the pattern in the order of operations that occurRegardless of an inbound or outbound webhook we generally have a Trigger and action in one app that then sends information to another appIn this second app, there is another trigger and then the last actionHence the title..Order: ""trigger, action, trigger, action."" Which denotes the flow of webhooks that are utilized by both appsEach has a single trigger and action that causes a connection between the twoYou will notice this same pattern in the examples below with the first app having a trigger and action --> which sends a payload to the next app that is an inbound webhook trigger followed by another action(A) Inbound Webhook “Catching” an Inbound Webhook Request in a HighLevel Workflow TriggerIn this scenario, we want HighLevel to catch information from an external appThe external app will send the Payload to the HighLevel Webhook URL provided when we create a Workflow Trigger - Inbound WebhookFor example, our use case above is an inbound webhook request where we send information from an external purchase into HighLevel to be used to perform unique tasks for those specific contacts who purchased the product1Enable Inbound Webhooks If you haven’t already, you will need to enable “LC Premium Triggers & Actions” in order to proceedTo catch an inbound request, we need an “Inbound Webhook” which is only available on LC Premium Triggers & ActionsDid you know..Most HighLevelers like to utilize integration and automation software like Zapier, Make, or PabblyThey come with easier-to-use triggers and actions for many applications you may be using alreadyIn many cases, it is simpler and more powerful to utilize one of these platforms in combination with HighLevel WorkflowsLearn more about Zapier, Make, and Pabbly here2Create the Webhook URL in a HighLevel Workflow Trigger Now we need to open our HighLevel Workflow and create the Webhook URLOpen/Create your workflow then select the “Inbound Webhooks” as the Workflow triggerA HighLevel Webhook URL will be createdCopy this Webhook URL to be used in the next step3In the External App, Create a Webhook Action Step In your external app of choice, you will need to create a trigger and webhook action stepFor example: In Zapier, you can use a “Payment” trigger to fire when a payment is madeWe can use the “Webhooks By Zapier” to POST the payload to the HighLevel Webhook URLPaste the HighLevel Webhook URL from step two into the Zapier Action Step4Send a Test Now we need to send a sample payload to our HighLevel Webhook URL in order to proceedWithin your external app, Zapier in this example, go to the end of the step and hit “Test Step.” For sending a test payload in HighLevel for an external app, please consult your external app documentation and SupportIn HighLevel, continue to wait and refresh the “Mapping Reference” Section until you have a “Mapping Reference” in HighLevel available to select5Create/Update Contact For HighLevel, we require a contact for every single Automation to runThis is why the “Create/Update Contact” will open automaticallyYou can also use the ""Find Contact"" Action to locate a contact based on a custom field or another valueIt is required to have this filled out, otherwise, this will NOT work and the Workflow will breakSo at minimum, create/update the phone or email from the payload of the inbound webhook or find a contact based on a custom field or suchA contact found or matched is required in order for this to workNow you are done! You have the information in HighLevel to map and use as you like within the WorkflowMapping Information in HighLevel Now you can use this information within ""Custom Values"" > ""Inbound Webhook Trigger"" to map the information from the payload into the correct fields or actions in HighLevelSo when it runs, the right information from the Inbound WEbhook will populate in the correct place in HighLevelLearn more about Inbound Webhooks in HighLevel hereWant to learn more about Zapier and how to use it? Getting Started with Zapier(B) Outbound Webhook “Sending” an Outbound Webhook Request with a HighLevel Workflow ActionIn this scenario, we are sending information from a HighLevel Workflow Action into an external appFor example, when someone fills out a form in HighLevel, we want this contact information to go into an External App so we can have the information about the contact there1Ensure that the External application allows for Receiving of Webhook Data For some external applications, receiving data from a webhook is a premium FeatureOther apps just simply need to have the trigger enabledYou will need to consult the documentation for the application and upgrade if neededIn Zapier, which we will use in this example, you must be on a paid account to use inbound Webhooks (known as Catchhooks) by ZapierNot Seeing Webhooks in Your External App? In some cases, webhooks may not be available within many External Apps for you to useIn these cases, you can check out automation/integration software like Zapier, Pabbly, or Make to bridge the information gap between your appsLearn more about Zapier, Make, and Pabbly here2Create a Webhook URL in the External App Within your External App create a trigger for the Inbound WebhookAfter creating this Trigger, you should have a Webhook URL generated to be used in later stepsFor example: In Zapier, you can use the “Webhooks By Zapier” Trigger with the “Catch Hook” EventContinue to the Trigger stepCopy the Webhook URL generated from the External App3Add the External Webhook URL to your HighLevel Workflow Action Now we can add the External Webhook URL to a HighLevel Workflow ActionCreate or open your HighLevel WorkflowAdd the External Webhook URL to a HighLevel Workflow ActionSave the workflow and publish it4Send a Test From HighLevel to the External App Now we need some sample information from HighLevel to the External AppTo do this, we need to trigger the workflowFor example, we can make a Test purchase so the Workflow Trigger will fire this information to ZapierIt is best to perform the workflow trigger as if it is a live-action of what will happenThis is because you want all of the example data provided in the payload when you go to use it in the External AppContinue testing until you have successfully sent the information to the External app and it has been received by the External AppWell done! Now every time the HighLevel Workflow triggers, it will send this information to your External App for usageWithin Zapier, you can now use this information to populate Spreadsheets or perform other unique tasksMapping Information in Zapier Select a field to update on your Zapier action, and then a popup will show an ""Insert Data"" which will allow you to select a placeholder (or Custom Value as it is known in highLevel) within the Zapier action to map the information in the payloadThis will stamp the data you want during every run of this webhook so the correct inforamtion from HighLevel updates the correct places in Zapier or your other third party appWant to learn more about Zapier and how to use it? Getting Started with ZapierFAQs What is Zapier, Make, or Pabbly? Zapier, Make or Pabbly are all Automation and integration softwareMeaning they exist to help connect applications togetherThey do this with pre-built connections to apps you can integrate into themAfter integrating, you can use a number of triggers and actions - much like you can in HighLevel WorkflowsHowever, these are triggers and actions for other applicationsFor example, did you know we have integrations with these softwares? Visit the links below from the most common platforms we have seen HighLevelers useZapier LC Integration Make LC Integration Pabbly LC Integration What makes these more powerful is combining these pre-built triggers and actions with webhook actionsThis will open an entire world of possibilitiesYou certainly can’t do everything… But hey… It’s better than coding a custom integration from scratch using an APIAt least they are pre-built and with webhooks, most of your tasks can be fully (or partially) automatedGetting Started with Zapier Zapier is one of the most commonly used Automation and Integration SoftwareWith thousands of pre-built triggers and actions between apps or platforms, it is a handy toolIf you are getting started with Zapier and not sure how to use it, check out their quick and informative Courseshttps://zapier.com/resources/guides/quick-start/automation-basics https://learn.zapier.com/intro-to-automation https://learn.zapier.com/path/a-complete-guide-to-lead-management Check out these links above to get started with Zapier today! What are Query Params? Query Params are a great way to pass in information via a webhookIt is much like UTM parameters, in that they add information to be used by the receiving applicationFor example, ClickUp is a popular task management appWhen you send information from ClickUp into HighLevel, the custom field does not come in cleanlyWhich is a bummer, custom fields are a critical part of the information we needSo we can pass in the information we need more cleanly with Query ParamsAll you have to do is add a query key and then the custom value to the Webhook URLFor example, our webhook URL is ""https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/pgWooooooooG57D/webhook-trigger/ce000-800f-4bec-0090-f000000000"" so then we can add a query key and a value to the URL like ""https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/hooks/pgWooooooooG57D/webhook-trigger/ce000-800f-4bec-0090-f000000000?custom_field={{click.up.custom.field.value}}"" After sending this to HighLevel, you are then able to select the query parameter cleanlyYou can add as many as you likeWhat are the Differences Between API and Webhooks? Application Programming Interface (API) is the back end (or back door) connection between appsIf you can’t do it natively within the app, chances are, you can find some API Documentation to help you achieve it or get close to itThe only issue is… API is complex to use, hence the wording “language.” It is a separate (and complex) language spoken between apps that you would need to learn to useTo make matters worse, every app has its own unique dialect or way of speaking these languagesAPI is hard to use but is powerful and worth consideringYou can find our HighLevel Developer Documentation here at https://developers.gohighlevel.com/Webhooks, on the other hand, are a bit more friendlyThey require a triggering event and are used to send information in response to a trigger - such as filling out a form, clicking a link, etcCompared to API, webhooks require a lot less knowledge to useWebhooks are a lot easier to use than API, which is why they are recommended before seeking an API connectionYou can learn more about webhooks here in this article above"

Subscription Charges The agency is charged a monthly subscription of $10 USD per locationAn agency can further rebill the subscription with a cost of their choice(by default this value is set at $29.99) making a profit of $19.99 per location per monthWhatsApp Full Setup Guide for Agency Conversation Based Pricing We charge per conversation, not per individual messageConversations are 24-hour message threads between you and your customersThey are opened and charged when messages you send to customers are deliveredThe criteria that determine when a conversation is opened and how it is categorized are explained belowConversation Categories Conversations are categorized into one of the following categories: Marketing — Enables you to achieve a wide range of goals, from generating awareness to driving sales and retargeting customersExamples include new product, service, or feature announcements, targeted promotions/offers, and cart abandonment remindersUtility — Enables you to follow-up on user actions or requestsExamples include opt-in confirmation, order/delivery management (e.g., delivery update); account updates or alerts (e.g., payment reminder); or feedback surveys[To be Released] Authentication — Enables you authenticate users with one-time passcodes, potentially at multiple steps in the login process (e.g., account verification, account recovery, integrity challenges)Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations can only be opened with template messagesService conversations can only be opened with free-form messagesSee Opening Conversations belowTo learn how to choose an appropriate category when creating your templates, see Template CategorizationOpening Conversations Conversations are opened when you send a template message or free-form message under the following conditionsMarketing, Utility, and Authentication Conversations Marketing, utility, and authentication conversations are opened when you send an approved marketing, utility, or authentication template message to a customer and no open conversation with that category exists between you and that customerFor example, if an open authentication conversation exists between you and a customer and you send them another authentication template message within 24 hours, a new conversation is not openedIf you send them a marketing message, however, a new marketing conversation is opened, resulting in two open conversationsService Conversations Service conversations are opened when you are within a customer service window, you send a free-form message to a customer, and no open conversation of any category exists between you and the customerFor example, if an open conversation of any category exists between you and a customer and you send them a free-form message within 24 hours, no new conversation is openedHowever, if no open conversation exists and the customer messages you (which starts a customer service window) and you reply within 24 hours with a free-form message, a new service conversation is openedCustomer Service Windows When a customer messages you, a 24 hour timer called a customer service window startsIf you are within the window, you can send free-form messages or template messagesIf you are outside the window, you can only send template messagesConversation Duration Marketing, utility, authentication, and service conversations last 24 hours unless closed by a newly opened free-entry point conversationFree-entry point conversations last 72 hoursFree Entry Point Conversations A free entry point conversation is opened if (1) a customer using a device running Android or iOS messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad or Facebook Page Call-to-Action button and (2) you respond within 24 hoursIf you do not respond within 24 hours, a free entry point conversation is not opened and you must use a template to message the customer, which opens a marketing, utility, or authentication conversation, per the category of the templateThe free entry point conversation is opened as soon as your message is delivered and lasts 72 hoursWhen a free entry point conversation is opened, it automatically closes all other open conversations between you and the customer, and no new conversations will be opened until the free entry point conversation expiresOnce the free entry point conversation is opened, you can send any type of message to the customer without incurring additional chargesHowever, you can only send free-form messages if there is an open customer service window between you and the customerFor example, if the customer messages you via a Click to WhatsApp Ad at 10 am and you respond via a template message at 10 pm the same day: The free-entry point conversation starts at 10 pm and lasts 72 hoursYou can send template messages at no charge in those 72 hoursYou can send free-form messages until 10 am the next day, at which point the customer service window closes, as it is independent of the free entry point conversation (if the customer messages you again, however, it opens another 24-hour customer service window in which you can send free form messages)Rates Rates vary based on conversation category and country/region rateYou can download the rate card below [bottom of this] that corresponds to your WhatsApp Business Account's currency to see our rates by country/region for each conversation categoryThese rates apply for any conversation opened on or after June 1, 2023 at 12:00 AM, based on WhatsApp Business Account time zoneThe rates in the CSV file include a 5% Stripe payment processing fee charged to the agencyThis explains any difference you might notice compared to the rates listed on MetaRebilling WhatsApp Messages The prices you see on the reselling tab is the base rate for marketing templates in the UKHowever, the final cost for your client might be different due to two factors: Conversation Category: The type of conversation the template is used for may affect the priceCountry/Region Rate: Depending on where the WhatsApp message is being sent Applying the Pricing Multiplier Any multiplier you set will be applied to all these base pricesThis multiplier acts like a percentage increaseFor example, if you set a multiplier of 1.5X (which is equivalent to a 150% increase), all prices will be multiplied by 1.5 before charging your clientExample If the multiple is set to 1.5X, and if your customer sends a Marketing template to a US phone number the pricing charged to your customer will be as follows $0.0263 x 1.5X = $0.0395 This means the client will pay $0.0395 for that templateBy default the multiplier is set to 1.05X, this is to ensure the payment processing charges are taken into account when charging the location How does the billing work? When your client purchases WhatsApp it creates 2 subscriptions in the System Between your client's card & your Stripe Account so you can collect payment from your clients Between HighLevel & your Stripe account, you pay $10/month/location to HighLevel The monthly charge gets you free inbound and outbound messagesWhen the lead sends an inbound text it gives you a 24-hour window when you can text them backThe window keeps extending with every messageIf you need to do outreach or if it's been more than 24 hours you will need to use a campaign/template message which is chargedThat opens the conversation up for 24 hour window which again keeps extending with every message All the outbound template messages will be charged to the location and agency based on the Country the message is sent to and the type of Template [Marketing, Utility, Authentication and Services] usedAttached is the list for reference"

Mandatory 2FA for New SaaS Sub-Accounts,"All new SaaS sub-accounts will now have to verify their email and phone number before the sub-account users can access their account. TABLE OF CONTENTS Use Case How it works? Bypassing 2-Factor Authentication Use Case Protecting SaaS agencies from scammers who use VoIP numbers and disposable email IDs to create multiple sub-accounts. How it works? We have put 2-Factor Authentication in place for sub-account admins when they login to their accounts for the first time. As soon as they log in, first we will send a verification code to their registered email address which they have to enter in order to proceed. After email verification, the sub-account admin is asked to enter an SMS enabled phone number which will then get a verification code that they have to enter to gain access to their account. A phone number can NOT be used to create/verify another sub-account till 7 days after it has been used to verify a sub-account. Bypassing 2-Factor Authentication There is no way for a sub-account admin to bypass the 2FA. Agency admins will have the option to manually verify a sub-account (without any code) from the sub-account's Manage Client page. 2FA is enabled by default for all SaaS agencies and sub-accounts, and can NOT be disabled."

Locate your ""Per-Segment Costs""In our example, we are sending an outbound SMS for long codesSo we choose $0.0079 for this example----Outbound SMS Cost Equation:---- Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(Number of Segments)(Per-Segment Cost)] + [(Number of Segments)(Carrier Fees)] ----Example:---- Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(5)($0.0079)] + [(5)(Carrier Fees)] Step 3: Lookup Carrier Fees (≈$0.005) In the US and Canada, carriers like T-Mobile, AT&T, or Verizon charge you for inbound messages sent to their end usersPrices vary by carrier and change from time to timeTo locate the Carrier Fees by carrier, see the SMS Pricing pageScroll down to the ""Carrier Fees"" section and see the inbound SMS column for a specific carrier*Please note: carrier fee prices vary based on the type of number (long code, toll-free, and shortcode)Due to carrier fees being unique to the end user's number, we cannot calculate the cost until we know what carrier we are sending toTo overcome this barrier we can estimateWe suggest using the amount of ≈$0.005 as this is currently the highest carrier charge (as of the last edit to this article)The ""≈"" symbol stands for approximation, which is an estimated number for this exerciseFeel free to change this approximation to what feels best for your estimates based on the prices available on SMS Pricing----Outbound SMS Cost Equation:---- Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(Number of Segments)(Per-Segment Cost)] + [(Number of Segments)(Carrier Fees)] ----Example:---- Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(5)($0.0079)] + [(5)(≈$0.005)] IMPORTANT: Carrier fees can change from time to time so always check the SMS PricingAs of the last time this article was created approximately ≈$0.005 was a good estimatorHowever, it is always important to check the SMS Pricing for any changes to Carrier fees to better adjust your SMS cost estimationsStep 4: Calculate We are now ready to calculate the estimated cost of our text messageLet's walk you step by step through the processEstimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(5)($0.0079)] + [(5)($0.005)] First, let's multiply the ""number of segments"" (found in Step 1) by the ""per-segment costs"" (found in Step 2)Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [$0.0395] + [(5)($0.005)] Now we need to multiply the ""Number of Segments"" (found in Step 1) by the estimated ""Carrier Fees"" (found in Step 3)Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [$0.0395] + [$0.025] Lastly, we add the two sums together to finish our estimation[$0.0395] + [$0.025] = $0.0595 We finally arrived at the final cost of 5.95 cents for this textEstimated Cost of Outbound SMS = $0.0595 or 5.95 cents IMPORTANT: This is an estimationFinal price can only be known after sendingAdding an image, hidden characters, emojis and other factors can impact the cost of an SMSSee SMS PricingTo understand more of the factors impacting final SMS price, see the section below the section Understanding the Factors Impacting SMS CostsMake a Copy of Our SMS Cost Estimator Sheet Now that we understand how to properly estimate the cost of an SMS, we can check out this SMS Cost Estimator Sheet we made for youThe SMS Cost Estimator Sheet enables you to ""Make a Copy"" of a Google Sheet we created to help you calculate the estimated cost of your SMSWe use the same SMS Cost Equestion we explained above in this sheet, the best part is you can plug in the information and we will calculate it for you on the sheetOpen the sheet from the link below and ""Make a Copy"" of itSMS Cost Estimator Sheet (""Make a Copy"" of this sheet to edit it) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rhJKukw4Y8G2KCqpphuhY6Q51zrohNmraCChVh-ETAI/edit#gid=0 This is an estimator, final costs will vary based additional factorsLearn more in the section below titled ""Understanding the Factors Impacting SMS Costs."" See SMS Pricing hereUnderstanding the Factors Impacting SMS Costs Many factors that impact the cost of an SMSSMS direction (inbound/outbound), the number of segments, carrier fees, number validation, adding an image, hidden characters, and moreBelow we will walk through the most common factorsPer-Segment Cost Number of Segment Cost Adding an Image (MMS) Using Emojis Hidden Characters Carrier Fees Carrier Lookup Fees Direction (Inbound/Outbound) International Messaging Per-Segment Cost An SMS is made up of segments and each segment is 160 characters longSo if you are sending a lengthy SMS, it will consume multiple segments and thereby drive up your costAdditional factors can increase the character count and SMS costs, like adding an image, hidden characters, or emojisYou can locate the Per-Segment cost by repeating Step 2: Lookup Per-Segment Cost aboveTo learn more about segments, see What The Heck Is A Segment? IMPORTANT: In the US/Canada, one segments contains 160 characters, however, having between 161 to 320 characters will automatically result in 2 segments..Having between 321 to 480 characters will result in 3 segments..and so on..Character lengths of segments also vary by countries & regions which will impact final SMS priceMost countries use 160 characters or 70 characters for segment lengths, depending on the encoding typeGenerally, most messages use the standard GSM-7 encoding, which gives us our 160 characters per segmentNumber of Segments Text messages are processed and priced based on the number of segmentsThis means the more segments you have in an SMS, the greater the cost of your text will beSuch as the example we calculated above in our example for the section ""The Steps to Estimating Outbound SMS Costs"" was 5 segments longMeaning it would cost approximately five times the amount of a text that has only one segmentFor example: A 5 segment message is..[(5)($0.0079)] + [(5)($0.005)] = cost of 5 Segment SMS [$.0395] + [$0.025] = $0.0695 or 6.95 cents However, a 1 segment message is..[(1)($0.0079)] + [(1)($0.005)] = cost of 1 Segment SMS [$0.0079] + [$0.005] = $0.0129 or 1.29 cents Adding an Image (MMS) MMS is the name for a text that includes a media attachment, such as an imageAdding an image moves you to the MMS costing rather than the SMSWhen you send a picture with your text, you get charged the standard MMS Message Fee and MMS Carrier FeeFind the MMS costs on the MMS Pricing pageFor example: Let's say we have our 5-segment message we sent above and we want to include an image as wellThis would remove the SMS pricing and MMS pricing would apply so the final cost would increase by the MMS rate as MMS pricing per segment is higherEstimated Cost of MMS Text = [(Number of Segments)(Per-Segment MMS Cost)] + [(Number of Segments)(MMS Carrier Fees)] Estimated Cost of MMS Text = [(5)($0.02)] + [(5)($0.01)] [$0.10] + [$0.05] = $0.15 or 15 cents Messages sent can include up to 10 media files that have a total size of up to 5MBAnything over 5 MB is uploaded to your HighLevel media library and a short link is created that you can use to send to the contact to share with your customersMessages with over 5MB of media will not be acceptedUsing Emojis Using emojis is a great way to make your automation exciting but being aware of the costs involved will help you make an informed decision about their frequency of usageEmojis are the most common reason for unexpected high costs while sending SMS automationSo use them wiselyFor example In the example below, we have a 1 segment message if we use the characters aloneHowever, we added some emojis which increased the number of segments from 1 to 4Maybe one emoji is enough? Hidden Characters Many agencies copy/paste the SMS text body while designing automationWhen you copy/paste text from a text editor software like MS Word or Google Docs, sometimes hidden characters get appended in the stringThese hidden characters can not be seen by the user but they are present in the textExample In this example a simple phrase Hey there was copied from a webpageUsually, it should be just 1 segmentBut actually, it contains many hidden characters (empty characters) making this as large as 4 segmentsYou can use https://twiliodeved.github.io/message-segment-calculator/ to check the actual number of segments & character length of your SMS textWhile pasting contents of an SMS to System text editor it is recommended to use paste as plain text option instead of simple pasteTo plain text paste..Windows -- Press ""Ctrl + Shift + V"" Mac -- Press ""Cmd + Shift + V"" Carrier Fees As we reviewed in Step 3: Lookup Carrier Fees (≈$0.005) above, carrier fees are charged by carriers like Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T when you send a message to one of their end-user numbersYou will also notice from the Outbound SMS Cost Equation reviewed above (and included below), that carrier fees are charged by segmentThis means that the more segments you have in an SMS will result in higher costs as the number of segments is multiplied by the Carrier Fees----Outbound SMS Cost Equation:---- Estimated Cost of Outbound SMS = [(Number of Segments)(Per-Segment Cost)] + [(Number of Segments)(Carrier Fees)] *See how the number of segments is multiplied by the carrier fees""[(Number of Segments)(Carrier Fees)]"" meaning a reduction in segments will reduce carrier feesFurther, remember there is a difference between SMS and MMS carriersCarrier Lookup Fees Carrier Lookup Fees (CARRIER-LOOKUP-FEES) are incurred on the first SMS you attempt to send to a contactIt is part of the SMS / Phone Number Validation featureThis feature will check to see if this number is real and if it can receive SMS/MMSThis saves you money in the long run, as without this, you would risk sending a text to fake numbers incurring full charges for the textWhereas, with Number Validation, you can check to see if the number is valid before sendingWhich is a lot cheaper over timeDirection (Inbound/Outbound) In the example above, we calculated a 5-segment OUTBOUND messageMeaning we are sending a message from our system to a numberHowever, if you receive a reply from this number, you are charged for inbound messages as wellFor example, open the SMS Pricing page, then locate the ""Inbound"" column to see the pricing for a particular inbound messageThis reveals the Inbound cost of an SMS for a Long Code (10-digit) numberTo calculate the cost of an Inbound text, you simply need to change the costs in our equation to the INBOUND cost listed on the SMS Pricing page as seen aboveThen you run the calculationEstimated Cost of INBOUND Text = [(Number of Segments)(Per-Segment INBOUND SMS/MMS Cost)] + [(Number of Segments)(INBOUND SMS/MMS Carrier Fees)] *Be sure to reference the ""Inbound"" column on the SMS Pricing page, as well as referencing SMS vsMMS costs when plugging in your variablesInternational Messaging In the example above, we are sending from a US/Canada Number to another US/Canada NumberHowever, if you happen to send a text to a non-US/Canada Number you will be subject to the recipient country feesFor example, if we send a text from a US/Canada Number to an Australian Number, you will be charged based on the Australian SMS PricingRemember, we can look up the messages for all countries by adjusting the ""Messages in"" drop-down window and then selecting the country of the recipients you send toWe review this in Step 2 aboveIn this example, the Per-Segment costs in US/Canada might be $.0079 while Australian costs are $.0515 which is roughly 6.5 times the standard rate for US/Canada NumbersSending to International numbers can greatly impact SMS costsGenerally you are only charged the destination country pricing, however, in some cases other fees can applySending a single SMS as a test is a great way to see costs for these cases as final pricing for international numbers vary base on international country rules and regulationsFAQs Am I charged for unsent SMS? NoIf there's an internal error with LC Phone before the message is handed off to the phone provider, you won't be chargedHowever, charges apply to every message where a delivery attempt has been made, regardless of the final delivery statusThis includes messages sent from toll-free numbers, A2P numbers, and those not deliverable due to country restrictions or other factorsWe urge users to be fully informed and cautious before sending messages, as refunds will not be provided for undelivered SMSWhy Are My SMS Costs So High? After you have sent multiple SMS, you may be looking at your bill questioning why it looks higher than you expectedIt is normal to feel this way if this is the first time you have examined your SMS Cost breakdownIf you haven't already, review the The Steps to Estimating Outbound SMS Costs section above so you can understand how a standard outbound SMS is pricedThen continue belowThe most comment reason for high SMS costs is an SMS with multiple segmentsText messages are processed and priced based on the number of segments within an SMSThis means the more segments you have in an SMS, the greater the cost of your text will beSuch as the example we calculated above in our example for the section ""The Steps to Estimating Outbound SMS Costs."" In this example, we had 5 segments in this single text, thus the cost was 5 times the listed per-segment rateMeaning it would cost approximately five times the amount of a text that has only one segmentReducing the number of segments in your SMS can reduce the SMS costTo do this, open the Segment Calculator and paste your message into itWork to reduce the ""Number of Segments"" to lower numbers to reduce the total costsMany factors can impact SMS pricingReducing segment count and not including any images or attachments can help reduce cost but there are other factors to considerReview Factors Impacting SMS Cost above, to better understand more factors in SMS costsThis will help you adjust your SMS to best fit your needs"

Achieving Compliance: Meeting Google and Yahoo's Email Sender Requirements in 2024,"As of February 2024, Google and Yahoo are requiring email senders to use email authentication, and adhere to important policy changes related to user consent and engagementIf senders don't follow these rules, their emails may be delayed, blocked, or marked as spamEven though this might feel like a sudden change, these requirements have been industry-wide best practices for maximizing email deliverability for quite some timeTABLE OF CONTENTS 1Elevate Your Brand with a Branded Sending Domain 2Establish DMARC Email Authentication for Your Sending Domain 3Ensure Brand Consistency 4Avoid pretending to be Gmail in the ""From"" headers of your emails 5Make it easy to Unsubscribe 6Optimize Email Delivery: Keep Your Spam Rate Below 0.30% Prepare Your Account: Follow our checklist to make sure you meet the new sender requirements set by both Google and Yahoo1Elevate Your Brand with a Dedicated Sending Sub-Domain Enhance control over your sender reputation and improve inbox branding by setting up a branded sending sub-domainSay goodbye to the ""sent via msgsndr.com"" disclaimer and embrace this deliverability best practiceKeep in mind that after enabling your dedicated sending sub-domain, a gradual warm-up of your sending infrastructure will be necessary over the subsequent 2 – 4 weeksNeed assistance? Check out our guide on setting up a dedicated sending sub-domainExample of what a Dedicated Sending Domain looks like to Gmail users: 2Establish DMARC Email Authentication for Your Sending Domain What is DMARC? DMARC (short for Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) is a standard that enhances SPF and DKIMIt communicates a policy to mailbox providers, guiding them on how to handle emails which fail SPF, DKIM, or both, claiming to be from your domain (potentially spoofed)What should you do? If you lack a DMARC record AND are sending more than 5,000 emails per day (aggregated for sub-accounts using a shared sending domain), you should add one to your DNSImplementation Steps: 1Use a free DMARC checker like Dmarcian to find out if you already have a DMARC record in placeEnter your root domain (ie: yourdomain.com) and hit inspectIf you see ""Hooray! Your DMARC record is valid."", you're good to go - ignore the following stepsIf not, continue to step 22Visit your DNS hosting provider and create a TXT DNS record3Choose TXT as the record type4Set the Host/Name value as: _DMARC 5In the Content/Points to field, enter: v=DMARC1; p=none; Keep in-mind that Google recommends gradually changing your DMARC policy over time to be more restrictiveYou can read about this process in their Recommended DMARC Rollout Tutorial documentHere's what the record would look like if setting up in Cloudflare for a domain called demohighlevel.com: 6Save/submit and use Dmarcian to verify the DMARC record has successfully been added (it may take a few minutes to register)You can also check by sending yourself an email and inspecting the headerIn Gmail, you can inspect the header of an email by clicking the three-dots icon and selecting the ""Show More"" optionHere's what the header will look like for an email that was sent from a domain that has a valid DMARC record in place: 3Ensure Brand Consistency Align your ""from"" address with your dedicated sending domain for a cohesive and recognizable email identityTo align with DMARC standards, your ""from"" address domain must match the root domain of your branded sending domainFor example, if your dedicated sending domain is ""lc.msgsndr.com,"" the corresponding root domain is ""msgsndr.com."" Thus, using ""hello@msgsndr.com"" as your ""from"" address maintains alignment with the root domainDouble-check all ""from"" addresses in your flow emails and campaigns to ensure alignment4Avoid pretending to be Gmail in the ""From"" headers of your emails Why does it matter? Gmail and Yahoo is beginning to enforce the ""quarantine"" DMARC policyIf you try to act like you're sending from Gmail or Yahoo, it will reduce the likelihood your emails will be delivered to a recipients inboxWhat's the solution? Keep it simple: never pretend to be Gmail or Yahoo in the ""From"" fields of your emailsFor instance, don't send emails claiming to be from ""example@gmail.com"" or ""example@yahoo.com."" 5Make it easy to Unsubscribe Now, it's important for senders to make it easy for recipients to stop receiving emails If someone doesn't want the emails anymore, they shouldn't have to search for the unsubscribe buttonIf you use LC Email Service, take a look at this blog postTurning on this option will automatically include an unsubscribe link in the footer of all your emailsStreamlined Unsubscribing: One-Click Solution We've got good news for you!

A Guide to Email Attribution Settings: How to customize it?,"The conversion metric is a vital tool to gauge how effectively your marketing campaigns contribute to revenue generation. An essential element of this metric is the attribution window, representing the timeframe when a customer's action is linked to a specific marketing touchpoint. Attribution Window Customization: Default: Our system uses a 5-day attribution window for email campaigns. Customize: Easily adjust the window in your account's email settings to match your business needs. Steps to Customize: Navigate to the email marketing section. Access email settings. Adjust the attribution window as per your preferences. Why 5 Days? Research suggests subscribers forget emails after 5 days, aligning with industry insights and ensuring a more accurate reflection of campaign impact. Understanding Email Attribution: Let's explore how email attribution works through an illustrative example, using the default 5-day attribution window. Day 1: Send an email to your subscriber. Day 3: Subscriber opens the email with a product offering. Day 4: Subscriber revisits and makes a purchase. In this scenario, revenue is attributed to the email campaign because the purchase occurred within the 5-day attribution window. However, it's crucial to note that if the customer were to make the purchase on day 10, it would not be attributed to the original email. Attribution Style: Customizing Your Analysis All Campaigns (Default): Attributions default to all campaigns for a comprehensive overview. Product Element Specific: Choose to attribute conversions exclusively to product-centric campaigns. How to Customize Attribution Style: Navigate to Email marketing. Access settings. Easily toggle between ""All Campaigns"" and ""Product Element Specific"" based on your preferences. Customizing the attribution window and style enhances your campaign analysis. With flexibility in duration and focus, our platform empowers data-driven decisions for optimized performance. Experiment, stay informed, and see your marketing efforts yield meaningful results."

Calendar Availability - Weekly Working Hours & Date-Specific Hours,"In This Article Overview Weekly Working Hours (formerly Standard Availability) Date-Specific Hours (formerly Custom Availability) Important Points to Note Overview Previously, we had two distinct availability configurations: Standard Availability and Custom AvailabilityWith recent updates, these have evolved into Weekly Working Hours and Date-Specific Hours - two types of availability settings to cater to your diverse needsIn the past, the availability settings operated independently of each otherNow, you can configure both your weekly working hours and date-specific hours concurrently, providing a more dynamic and adaptable scheduling experienceIt allows you to maintain a consistent weekly schedule while accommodating unique circumstances on specific datesUnderstanding the distinction between these two can help you effectively manage your calendar and ensure that it aligns with your real-time availabilityPREVIOUSLY VS NOW AT PRESENT Weekly Working Hours (formerly Standard Availability) Weekly working hours represent your regular availability on a recurring basisThis is useful for setting up your default schedule that repeats week after weekFor instance, if you're consistently available every Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 8 AM to 10 PM, you can configure these hours as your weekly working hoursThe system will then automatically apply this schedule to those days and times every weekDate-Specific Hours (formerly Custom Availability) Date specific hours allow you to customize your availability or unavailability for specific datesYou can add specific dates and define hours applicable only to those datesThis feature is particularly helpful for handling exceptional circumstances, holidays, or personal commitmentsHere are a few examples to illustrate its usage: Example 1: Holidays You can mark upcoming holidays such as Easter, Christmas, or bank holidays as unavailableDuring these specific dates, your calendar will reflect that you are not available, ensuring accurate schedulingExample 2: Personal Commitments In cases where you have prior personal commitments that deviate from your regular schedule, you can easily adjust your availability for those specific datesFor instance, if you have a doctor's appointment on 10th February, 2024 from 12 PM to 3 PM, you can mark yourself as unavailable during that time without the need to create a blocked slotExample 3: Extended Availability For special occasions like a long weekend where you want to extend your working hours for a limited duration, you can use date specific hours to modify your availability only for those specific daysNote: To mark your unavailability, simply select the date and, under the timeslot click on the delete iconImportant Points to Note Weekly Hours vsDate Specific Hours: Weekly hours represent your standard, recurring schedule, while date specific hours allow for specific adjustments on selected datesHierarchy of Hours: Date-Specific Hours will always take precedence over the Weekly Working HoursIn other words, if you have set specific hours for a particular date, those hours will override the default weekly working hours for that dayMarking Availability/Unavailability: Date specific hours provide the flexibility to mark both your availability and unavailability for specific dates, giving you complete control over your calendarBy leveraging both weekly working hours and date specific hours, you can create a flexible and accurate representation of your availability, ensuring a seamless scheduling experience for both you and those interacting with your calendar"

My Affiliate Commission Looks Incorrect," Does your commission amount look different from what you were expecting? Here are a few potential causes: If HighLevel is running a promo, such as a Black Friday / Cyber Monday deal, usual commission amounts could be lower than normal. If the commission is the product of a referral upgrading their HighLevel plan, the commission amount will be prorated in accordance with the day of the upgrade. If your referred customer receives a refund from the HighLevel team, it will show up as a negative balance in your portal. Note: An overall negative balance does not mean you owe money, but you will need to generate enough commission to counteract the negative amount in order to receive a payout. If your commission amount looks correct but you’re not receiving the payments, please refer to this article. "

On the other hand, in Agent Reporting, the filter is applied based on individual agents/staff membersQ: Why might there be a mismatch between Call Reporting and Agent Reporting data? A: The mismatch between Call Reporting and Agent Reporting data can occur due to the nature of how calls are trackedIn Agent Reporting, the call count includes all contacts assigned to Max, as well as calls received or made by MaxHowever, in Call Reporting, the calls made to contacts assigned to Max may have been handled by someone else, leading to differences in statisticsQ: How can I ensure accurate reporting when comparing data from Call Reporting and Agent Reporting?

Guide To Bulk SMS: Send Messages People Actually Want To Receive,"This guide will: Help you understand some of the rules that apply to SMS marketing (US and Canada)Maximize the impact of SMS for: Client responses Marketing ppt Ins Appointment conversions Closing sales Composing Your Message Compliance in your SMS body Seek consent from your text recipient before including them in your SMS campaign Always identify yourself and your business by nameIf it’s the first time you’re messaging a contact, OR if it’s been 90 days or more since you last messaged them, be sure to add an unsubscribe clause at the very end of your message“Reply STOP to opt out.” “If you’d like us to stop texting you, just reply STOP.” If someone opts out of receiving future texts, be sure to remove them from your future SMS campaigns! Strategic Best Practices Greet each contact by using the first name custom value → {{contact.first_name}} Use sparingly, no more than once per month Respect people’s time and attention by only sending in specific time windows that are least likely to disturb personal time For measurable results, use a strong offer Make your message clear and concise to avoid turning people off and increasing unsubscribesConsider offering something for free to maximize interest or responses Minimal commitment now = maximum number of conversations that will build trust and belief throughout the sales process Keep messages short and exciting Think about how your message will make the average contact feel Avoid needless punctuation, specifically overuse of exclamation points, to increase reading speed Avoid formal writing styles and match the casual tone of a typical text message conversation Spark conversations Creating live conversations = a direct connection with a potential customer It builds trust Which leads to increased sales momentum Which builds your reputation Ask a direct question to prompt responses Do not ask more than one question, as this can cause confusion Do not overuse emojis Avoid sending links This can cause deliverability issues It also neglects all the great benefits of chat conversations Only send out messages when you know you can respond in a timely manner Contacts who respond right away and then never hear back will think your message was sent in bulk or spam As such, contacts who get responses right away will be more likely to convert Be prepared for unsubscribes You will always get some people responding STOP You will always get some people to ask not to be texted anymore Respect their wishes, mark them DND, and move on Bad Example “Hello, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness ?? We’re the best gym in town! All our members are models! It’s ? $175/month ? to join and there’s an extra $150 new member fee ?… We have a lot of spots to fill so we hope you can afford it! We also have personal training, group classes, a 6 week challenge, nutrition plans, sauna, ice baths, an inner circle club, work-trade spots available, and many other add-ons!” Good Example “Hi {{contact.first_name}}, this is Ashley from Bob’s Fitness, we’re giving out a few 10-day passes and I wondered if you’d like one? If you’d like for us to stop texting you, reply STOP” Technical Setup and Execution Select the contacts you’d like to messageNeed help filtering a list? Check out ""Getting Started with Smart Lists"" Click the “Send SMS” button (picture of icon) Click “Ok, Proceed” Type your message Title the action for internal reference If you want to send the message to everyone at the same time immediately, leave the toggle on “Send all at once.” This is good for 1-way announcements you do not expect to turn into conversations and want to send right awayIf you want to send the message to everyone at the same time later, select “Send all at schedule time” and then set the send time in the “Start On” fieldThis is good for 1-way announcements you do not expect to turn into conversations and want to send automatically at a later time If you want to slowly deliver the message to the list of contacts over time, select “Send in drip mode” This is good for messages you expect to generate responses and conversations Start On The day and time when messages should start sending Batch Quantity The number of messages that sends each time the Repeat After condition is met Repeat After The amount of time to wait until sending out the next Batch Quantity Send On The days of the week the system will allow messages to send Process Between Hours (optional) The window, or timeframe within each day in which the system will send messages.Example of a Drip sending 100 messages per day spread out between 10:30am-11:00am each dayAction: “Database Reactivation: Black Friday Weekend Promo” Start On: November 29th Batch Quantity: 10 Repeat After: 3 minutes Send On: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thr, Fri, Sat, Sun Process Between Start From: 10:30AM End At 11:00AM"

From the Manage Client page, retrieve the Stripe customer ID of each sub-account and verify if they are the sameIf they are the same, then the Stripe customer is shared between the sub-accounts, and this behavior is expectedIf you do not want this to happen, the only solution is to assign different Stripe customers to each sub-accountTo do this: Keep the SaaS mode active for only one sub-account and disable SaaS for the other account Re-enable using the ""Share a link or Request via SMS or Request via email"" optionThis will create a new customer in Stripe and link it to that sub-accountWhy is the client unable to add payment details on the sub-account's company billing page? If they received the error message 'No such customer' or 'stripe.confirmPayment(): expected either elements or `clientSecret`, but got neither.'

Whenever the client purchases a SaaS subscription directly on Stripe or via funnels or a sale link, we create a new sub-accountIf the sub-account already exists, in that case, you need to add a subscription only via the Manage Client page to avoid a new sub-account being createdWhy aren't the sub-accounts getting created when the client purchases the subscription via funnels? Verify whether the product added in the funnels is tagged as an agency plan under Payments > ProductsSub-accounts are only created if the product is tagged as an agency planIf the product is tagged as an agency plan and sub-accounts still aren't created, please share the order ID or subscription ID and the date when the subscription was purchased with our support team for further investigationImporting SaaS plans to your sub-account: Create plan in SaaS configurator Switch to your sub-account > Payments > Products Select 'Import from Stripe' Select the product that you just created (or that already existed), proceed Check for the 'Agency_Plan' label in products list, and start sellingHow do I move the subscription from one sub-account to another sub-account that has no subscription?

Why is the ""Can't disconnect because SaaS clients are using this Stripe account!"" warning shown for $97 and $297 agencies as well? Why is there no option to disable SaaS on the Manage Client page? Before you disconnect the agency Stripe Connect, SaaS mode should be disabled for all the sub-accountsFor the 497 agency, you can disable SaaS on the Manage Client page one by one for each sub-account, or you can raise a support ticket to disable it all at onceEven for the 97 and 297 agencies, when the payment method is added, in the background, we are enabling SaaSSo, to resolve this, please raise a support ticket to disable SaaS for all the sub-accounts since we don't provide that option on the Manage Client page for $97 and $297 agenciesSecurity Even though 2-Factor Authentication is turned off in SaaS Configurator > Security, why does it still require 2FA to be completed?

On the sub-account list, please verify if a banner with the following message is displayed: ""This sub-account is paused due to pending email and phone verification from the sub-account adminClick here to review and resume this sub-account."" If yes, then it means that the sub-account is in a ""verification pending"" state, in other words, 2FA is pending for the sub-account(s)This is why the sub-account was not moved to ""LC,"" and rebilling is not enabledOnce the 2FA is verified, the sub-account will be automatically moved to LC, a Twilio account will be created, and rebilling will also be automatically enabled if it is enabled on the SaaS PlanIt's important to note that 2FA will NOT block client's access to the sub-accountThey only need to complete email verification during the first phone number purchase"

Better: “- You work for {{ai.business_name}}, your goal is to assist customers, qualify them on the basis of the answers they give to the questions you ask from the Script, and if qualified, you help them book appointments- Always maintain the persona of a human assistantDo not disclose, suggest, or hint at being an AI assistant unless askedUse colloquial language and phrases like ""Great,"" ""Got it,"" or ""Understood"" instead of formal apologies or offers of help- Acknowledge the user's input by repeating it back for clarity once at the startAfter that, use varied affirmations or transitions without repeating the user's exact words- Maintain a professional, yet casual demeanorUse periods instead of exclamation points to moderate the tone- You are talking to {{contact.name}}Use the customer's first name only at the beginning and end of the conversation to avoid redundancy."" Task; specifying Instructions and Objectives Worse: “You are required to qualify customers by asking them questions then asking them to book an appointmentIf they are not interested, just collect their details.” Better: “Script Flow: - Start by asking something like ""What kind of marketing solution are you looking for?""If not interested, politely ask for their email and offer to stay in touch for future opportunities- If they have a positive response, ask ""What telephony provider do you use for your marketing agency rn?""- Once the customer has responded positively to all the asked questions through the conversation, only then propose scheduling a call with the team to discuss further- Before suggesting a booking, ask for their email address for booking the appointment if you do not already have it- Then help them book a callOnce booked, thank them and end the conversation on a positive note; looking forward to the scheduled call."" Guidelines; Guardrails for the bot to abide by (You can specify these under Role and Instructions as well) Worse: ""Reply in a concise mannerAsk all the questions in script and then have them book an appointment.” Better: “- Keep answers short, direct, and within a 20-word limit- Always wait for the user's response before asking the next question from the Script- Only have them book an appointment if they respond positively to the Script questions.” Best Practices in action Repetition As we want our bot to follow the sales script we have put in place, we’d repeat/reference it multiple timesIn Role we have: “- You work for {{ai.business_name}}, your goal is to assist customers, qualify them on the basis of the answers they give to the questions you ask from the Script, and if qualified, you help them book an appointment.” In Guidelines we have: “- Always wait for the user's response before asking the next question from the Script- Only have them book an appointment if they respond positively to the Script questions.” Examples/Illustrations In Role we have: “- Always maintain the persona of a human assistantDo not disclose, suggest, or hint at being an AI assistant unless askedUse colloquial language and phrases like ""Great,"" ""Got it,"" or ""Understood"" instead of formal apologies or offers of help.” It can also be written as: “EXAMPLES OF WHAT TO SAY AND WHAT NOT TO SAY: - Avoid: I didn't understand your response- Use: Wait, what did you say? Sorry, could you repeat that? - Avoid: I apologize for the confusion- Use: Sorry if that didn't make sense- Avoid: I understand your concern but I assure you our team is made up of highly trained professionals- Use: Yeah, it makes sense why you'd be concerned but trust me, our team is really good at what we do.” Advanced Prompting: As we want our bot to follow the sales script we have put in place, we’d repeat/reference it multiple timesStatic Information You can add context or information about your business, offers, services in the prompt itself if you want the bot to have access to it all the timeIt is recommended to keep the context under 100-200 words, as when the context size increases compared to the rest of the prompt, the prompt’s importance decreases for the AI ChatBot, as more of it is now around the context and not the prompt instructionsDelimiters These are special characters you would use to emphasise or demarcate certain pieces of text (e.gContext) in the prompt from other instructions in the promptFor emphasis you can use; #, >, < For demarcation you can use: “””, ‘’’, <> </> Example: Say you want to add some information about your offer in the prompt; Worse: “Offer: Elevate Your Business with Cutting-Edge A.IChatbots Transform the way you engage with your audience with our state-of-the-art A.Ichatbots, trusted by leading industry giantsUnlock the potential to skyrocket your lead generation, turbocharge sales, and redefine customer support, all while streamlining your operationsImagine capturing not just any leads, but premium, one-click email opt-ins that elevate your marketing gameDream of automating your sales process to generate revenue around the clockOur technology refines targeting, significantly reducing lead acquisition costs and boosting conversion ratesBut why stop there?
